SOS yes , good afternoon ladies , gentlemen . EOS
SOS and so i 'm going to thank you to speak here today . EOS
SOS and i 've got to think of myself now . EOS
SOS my name is christian levine , and i 'm crazy idea , as a result of the city . EOS
SOS that 's what 's called the age for eight years . EOS
SOS and my motto is : first of all , second , second organization , third public policy . EOS
SOS so i 'm responsible for that city . EOS
SOS and you do n't do it . EOS
SOS i know . EOS
SOS and beyond that , and that 's something that my son looks like , i 'm also . EOS
SOS that 's what i 'm going to do is to fire fire . EOS
SOS it 's blowing down and hours . EOS
SOS and that 's what i 've been thinking about , of course , is a subject i want to share with you today . EOS
SOS and that 's what happens with the theme of that , because it 's also how to fire fire . EOS
SOS we hope to look at the best and our focus of the worst one , which jack told me . EOS
SOS you know it . EOS
SOS he was at general . EOS
SOS and then i do n't start to say something very serious . EOS
SOS i 'll give you a position . EOS
SOS so we 're going to talk that if there is a risk of risk that we 're going to stand on a disaster like a second way , like a crash , so long ago , we die . EOS
SOS many people are left . EOS
SOS it is , it 's expanding . EOS
SOS and somewhere on the edge of the edge is a submarine , clay face , leave some other , maybe give birth to sign . EOS
SOS none seems to be here . EOS
SOS it 's not one of that . EOS
SOS all of a sudden of a sudden . EOS
SOS leave that . EOS
SOS police comes forward , fire . EOS
SOS people are calling . EOS
SOS sebastian betti EOS
SOS go out . EOS
SOS so what 's going on ? questions of clapping . EOS
SOS we do n't know or we 're not going to tell it . EOS
SOS people are leaving the building . EOS
SOS children cry . EOS
SOS some of them might be even because it needs to go quickly . EOS
SOS suddenly , all of a sudden . EOS
SOS there 's rhex in there . EOS
SOS it comes out of panic . EOS
SOS i 'm going to hear right now . EOS
SOS i 'm going to give the rest to their imagination . EOS
SOS but it 's not a fantasy that i 've chosen . EOS
SOS this is exactly what happened in this week . EOS
SOS there 's a such that 's happening there . EOS
SOS afterwards it turns out that only , in fact , nine pounds of drugs were in there . EOS
SOS but people were just like that , and so a friend told me that tells me out of the building . EOS
SOS it was n't told me . EOS
SOS and it happened to me that suddenly suddenly , at least in the group , which my friend was at my friend . EOS
SOS god is n't panic of panic , otherwise the whole reason would n't seem to be seen as safe as it seems . EOS
SOS you can see , in a file disaster , in a liberal culture , communication is very important . EOS
SOS communication is important because the people in this situation are close to communication . EOS
SOS they want to know what to go . EOS
SOS in the early days , in the good old time , that was just pretty simple . EOS
SOS we just did n't have said or we will . EOS
SOS why ? EOS
SOS because that 's what we 're going to do . EOS
SOS you have to tell people that god people would panic in panic , because we do n't want to see the truth or we 're going to tell them . EOS
SOS this is in a period of social media , in a time of twitter , at a time of facebook , at a time of private private and public services , not possible , in a period of EOS and public tv . EOS
SOS and it 's simple and because it is n't moral , and the second is often the last one as a report talking about the event . EOS
SOS now you may remember looking at the electron flow , a few years ago . EOS
SOS the first commandment that was coming at twitter . EOS
SOS one of someone who was on a cliff and was simple , and immediately immediately says , this is a plane , and we save people now . EOS
SOS that was no photoshop . EOS
SOS you can see , we 're on today today that are simply beginning to say the truth of the truth of the truth of the truth . EOS
SOS because most of us , of course , the last time we know the truth , because we also need the truth of this , of course that we are only able to grow out . EOS information . EOS
SOS because of course , public media or social media are either not that either , or not they 're doing it . EOS
SOS so , from that we 're going to eat in food , and that 's also something that has been through the media , and we 're thinking about how we deal with it in the future . EOS
SOS and we 're going to get rid of the great ones . EOS
SOS however , just as a form of the colony . EOS
SOS that 's what we 're going to build in the next few years , about a hundred megawatts in the building , which , some of you will remember that , when it comes to the bathroom . EOS
SOS in the past , it was about it . EOS
SOS you may probably know about this three times a minute ago , wait for a moment . EOS
SOS i do n't know anymore . EOS
SOS we 're going to grow this together with all the children we have in the place , so on facebook , talking about facebook , talking about radio , talking about the radio , over the television , and all over the internet , and the local media and so forth and so forth and immediately , EOS
SOS and we know we have to go very quickly and we 're going to act very quickly and we have to get very quickly , and we get really excited about that , because the population and the citizens are going to kill citizens . EOS
SOS and we also did n't even believe what we 're going to say . EOS
SOS communication in the crisis or so in the disaster is a question of all media that are available to us , and it 's also a matter of death . EOS
SOS in fact , our biggest problem is , because the people and the citizens are saying either , they 're going to do everything again , all right , or they say , it 's all much worse than it is in reality . EOS
SOS so we 've done good experiences with facebook and twitter , even recently . EOS
SOS you may have some of them in the media . EOS
SOS we 've had a bigger dose of food . EOS
SOS and this is a so-called chemical bomb . EOS
SOS these are bombs , which are linked to a handle , because they are not going to explode out the first stage on the edge , but through the homes in the second world war , and in fact on the ground because of a chemical reaction that is going to be EOS , that a little bit , the EOS
SOS the problem is just a lot of these bombs never worked , and they 're looking for the food under other food . EOS
SOS and there we have been from a young gentleman who was his conscience , as he said so nice to the report , so we got it , we were now , he 'd seen it like it , he had the bank government to realize that there 's a bomb . EOS
SOS by the way , there were thousands of thousands of thousands of mines sitting around it . EOS
SOS we 'll see what we 'll find . EOS
SOS these bombs are actually going to get to place , not going to be killed , but they 're going to be thrown . EOS
SOS and so we are basically able to do that at the very end park , and we have a sense of the word of the word a bomb . EOS . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS and in fact , in the history of the city of the city , the whole communication on facebook and twitter is going to run the result that the whole thing is happening at all the way over time . EOS
SOS and the media got excited . i 'm laughing in the background . EOS
SOS we did n't even have to sit with the phone , but they 've got over , and then , all over the ages , and twitter . EOS
SOS and the whole thing had an amazing effect for us , because the expansion is going to spread through these social media . EOS
SOS just so , you also have to give me a sign of sign when i stop . EOS
SOS i ca n't look at the watch here . EOS
SOS that 's because first of all these social media , they have the advantage they share information . EOS
SOS it 's not that much , because the members of those are going up or you calls them as to call them a great deal . EOS
SOS second , fast back home . EOS
SOS if something is n't true , it says somebody immediately immediately , so the rest of which i just talked about , which is going to go down , because the whole community is going to be involved in principle . EOS
SOS and it 's a very high quality of that , so if something is wrong , then it can be very quick . EOS
SOS and we 've got a huge disk . EOS
SOS i said yes , in fact , that what the design of thinking is like a bomb going to go up . EOS
SOS so , from that point , we 've been from all the things that happened in the last few years , and there are much more more than thinking of all the things that happened in the last few years , and it 's much more than a white line of view . EOS
SOS also , the city can eat a day of such a catastrophe like this . EOS
SOS a bomb that is going to be a park , that 's certainly not one . EOS
SOS but she can also , and even after that , we 're just going to find out in the stadium , and then we stand with our heel , and try to cut down into seven feet . EOS
SOS and if you think about them , think about other cities , if you have to go through it , because you 've just seen a film that you do n't have to escape in a standard , and then we already know that a lot of homes are EOS
SOS and that 's important to communicate , because in fact , in a world , it is necessary , communication to run communication , to run a panic , to keep panic , to make sure that the people are involved in a world , that people are able to put the EOS EOS
SOS and the social media also helps us become more effective , because ultimately , all of them are involved in communications , and it 's not just a smooth conversation like this , and we certainly certainly had a big part of the EOS
SOS from that today , today is not only a government of freedom , not just a job of fire or death , of course , the wheat , red cross , etc. , but communication in the disaster of justice and exchange of a catastrophe is all about . EOS
SOS and what 's happening is that . EOS
SOS there 's over twitter and over facebook a great part of the aid , if you 've had a lot of money , because suddenly you want to build any kind of energy building , and you did n't even want to know where the EOS EOS
SOS this shows there is still much to do , also to the public communications in the workplace , but with the general time , with the heel and the whole , just showing that the social media is from a childhood station , that the social media is coming from a non-zero-sum level of communication , from a communication of communication . EOS
SOS and i hope that i 've convinced you a little bit about that this medium , which is , in fact , is actually the beautiful stuff of life being used , even in its sense of your attention , to the citizens of the treatment and the citizens , and now that 's what we 've seen for EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS so , a beautiful good evening . EOS
SOS i 'm a believer different . EOS
SOS i 'm a writer , and i 've just heard as you just heard . EOS
SOS and i 'm just a little bit now to ask for reasons . EOS
SOS what it is , i 'm going to make it up there , which i 'm also going to do to you . EOS
SOS before i do that , i have a couple of things . EOS
SOS the first is , i think we really need stories really . EOS . EOS
SOS we ca n't live without stories . EOS
SOS i also think it 's going to be much more , more and more , more than more popular stories than what 's going to be done by doing . EOS
SOS then i think the internet is the internet , the infinite distance , of actually as good as anyone 's going to get properly seriously . EOS
SOS and four , i went to believe that people are being created to be creative . EOS
SOS and that they are happier as soon as they can be creative . EOS
SOS the more people are happy , the better the world . EOS
SOS all right . EOS
SOS the better world is now just an icon . EOS
SOS the first line i 'm like , as i said , was a storyteller . EOS
SOS and the story i want to tell you is beginning to start in a favela where it 's just singing happy . EOS
SOS that 's delicious . EOS
SOS and it 's comprised of death 's birthday . EOS
SOS now you get a lot of the math and the singing , not so much , because in the moment it 's gone , there 's something going to it . EOS
SOS it happens something in your head in your body , in your body , with your perception . EOS
SOS and she did n't really have words . EOS
SOS you do n't know what 's going on . EOS
SOS i 've got it . EOS
SOS i call that the legacy of trustworthiness . EOS
SOS you can see on a side of a page and a piece of crap , and everything is quite black . EOS
SOS i feel like i 'm a bit pretty disappointed . EOS
SOS morton bast EOS
SOS and on the other hand , we also have the ones in the middle of the country with very much color . EOS
SOS and it happened to that point that i 'd better and write better than i am . EOS . EOS
SOS so , the first thing that 's happening now with its new perception is a demographic man with a hundred hair , who 's sitting with her , it 's very serious and says , `` okay , your life is over . EOS
SOS that 's delicious . EOS
SOS and i think it 's encouraging to tell you that it is a very special type of people . EOS
SOS she was born as an outpatient . EOS
SOS the players are people who are about to play their way around their lifetime . EOS
SOS who are familiar with you ? EOS
SOS very beautiful . EOS
SOS imagine if you did n't get rid of this , when you meet each other , you meet each other when you meet each other , but make out of your pocket . EOS
SOS so dry , memory , break , all sorts of things . EOS
SOS which is really important , the players do n't have a glimpse of their actions . EOS
SOS we do n't know when we die . EOS
SOS i have a long life , but we do n't know . EOS
SOS it can also be over there . EOS
SOS and so it 's kind of like my players too . EOS
SOS they do n't even know how much they 're able to play . EOS
SOS that means every single minute would be the last one . EOS
SOS a player who has spent a whole different sense of death is going back at the moment of the same as a kidney that is going on . EOS
SOS now , you can ask , if that 's so dangerous , why are they all play ? EOS
SOS the answer is clear : that . EOS
SOS without play , without a player , around a course , everything gray , and only when a player is playing , it 's actually alive . EOS
SOS they were born to play . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS and this story of non-zero-sumness , and as you can tell the world of the player , the first challenges , and of course , you know , you know , in love with love that is the story i want to tell . EOS
SOS and it 's in a form of a colony . EOS
SOS the first pillar 12 consequences , i 'm sorry , i 'm here in a row that i 've just been seeing . EOS
SOS so , 12 people in the first run at a distance from five to seven minutes . EOS
SOS this type of loss , which is a series of the other , beautiful speech , you know , you know . EOS
SOS the television does n't have any other ever since . EOS
SOS it 's not new . EOS
SOS and if all of that would be , then i 'm going to get it first . EOS
SOS and yet , not here . EOS
SOS now we 're just right now . EOS
SOS let 's go back to again . EOS
SOS what is the most famous sentence from the film or from the series ? EOS
SOS there 's only one , right . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS as if we had that . EOS
SOS and that 's exactly what my player does n't mean . EOS
SOS there are many , many , many . EOS
SOS there are so many different games . EOS
SOS just think of that , of course , of course , like , click and so on . EOS
SOS and that 's exactly how the number of players have happened . EOS
SOS and so there 's a whole bunch of stories that everyone told them . EOS
SOS now the next question is : who would love this ? EOS
SOS i have a fairly high opinion of myself . EOS
SOS i am smart and extremely creative . EOS
SOS but i know that a hundred brains can produce more than just one , even if it 's mine . EOS
SOS so it just came up to the idea that the crowd of the crowd with the creative process . EOS
SOS what if we do n't just want to give away just the rule or allow it , but even more ? EOS
SOS so when you say we 're going to store you all very much , you 're going to have one of the design of this program . EOS
SOS imagine if you look at the answer , for example of the answer three , you 'll find a limb on it because you remember your grandfather . EOS
SOS furthermore , it 's a massive fan of titian . EOS
SOS and then you can now , today , with the current technology , it 's not so hard to do it . EOS
SOS and this store , she store the right up where it is right , and that 's really cool , really cool , which is really quite interested in the way . EOS
SOS that means it 's not anywhere under this , but it 's down right where it 's going to land . EOS
SOS the really cool thing is that we are on the web . EOS
SOS and on the web , you can really do everything . EOS
SOS so , every medium is sort of resistance . EOS
SOS that means as an audience you can write , draw , like whatever you want to do . EOS
SOS and if we look at that structure again . EOS
SOS so this looks a little bit out of the web , right ? EOS
SOS that 's how this works together . EOS
SOS and i 'm really glad that the internet was born to tell exactly these kinds of stories . EOS
SOS it 's not that many , not so many , no one . EOS . EOS
SOS so now i 'm going to go even further and get the audience to the player . EOS
SOS that 's what happens in a lexicon . EOS
SOS you can also talk about characters from this series , but also the people in the real environment , which also have these peaks in their cell phones . EOS
SOS the other thing that you 're familiar with is all very , very well , is this something like mobile , you know , `` mobile '' and you 're talking along . EOS
SOS these are these beautiful areas which are just very smooth . EOS
SOS and i ca n't go through that because i 'll take it back to 20 minutes . EOS
SOS we 're putting together . EOS
SOS each one of them is from three parts . EOS
SOS the first part is the torah , the second part is the canoe , and then we have that . EOS
SOS i 've been able to get on that piece of my mind , and i could see that in second , i need to think about it : to teach innovation . EOS
SOS the first price gave me the first price . EOS
SOS and i 've got to say , this is a killer factory from the banks of banks , from the philippines , and so on . EOS
SOS so , you know , if you want to do it . EOS
SOS and if i can convince you here , here with my one : the internet is to use existing structures , the way i think , i can really convince everybody . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS everyone is : why does this all mean ? EOS
SOS because it 's happening in this name all these areas . EOS
SOS and we 've got a look at the other hand : who is , i am , i am , you 're alive , everyone is off . EOS
SOS of course , these are dying . EOS
SOS in the series of several very , very much . EOS
SOS everyone is : everybody has to die . EOS
SOS and then , of course , everybody is in the sense of everyone when he wants it . EOS
SOS that 's totally important . EOS
SOS i come out of the back there , and there 's nothing worse about my opinion when it becomes like this . EOS
SOS i do n't know if you know it . EOS
SOS if you 're in theater and then the actor comes in and everybody 's like , oh , god , please . EOS
SOS and that 's not . EOS
SOS so it 's mobile interaction . EOS
SOS and nobody needs to . EOS
SOS it can be just the audience . EOS
SOS the reason why i 'm proposing is that the whole thing is going to be done in german , first . EOS
SOS this has a couple of reasons . EOS
SOS i came up with this project for a while , and i was thinking about this project , so let 's go all the way through english , which is bigger , blah , blah , blah , blah blah . EOS
SOS i 'm only going to say , the german hulk is the third of the world . EOS
SOS the head of death is the english , and then the prime minister , and then the german age . EOS
SOS so it 's not like we move into a little sticker . EOS
SOS furthermore , i really do n't really believe that when it comes to other people , like me , that people will be grateful for something that was n't going to be done by any way , where at the end of each and every EOS
SOS if that 's how i would like it , then the first answer is now on the first four example . EOS
SOS and if you ask now , why am i now , here at a toy where it 's under the nearest , it 's going to be running under the same stage . EOS
SOS i made a couple of thoughts . EOS
SOS i love that . EOS
SOS not only . EOS
SOS i 'm also quite dependent on a lot of straw and i cried . EOS
SOS a couple of years ago , they were also running around . EOS
SOS and i can only say that this whole knowledge is incredibly important and incredibly provocative . EOS
SOS but it does n't mean anything if you do n't apply it . EOS
SOS and my project is just about this thing where i just took everything i 've learned . EOS
SOS and it 's wireless . EOS
SOS and so far as well . EOS
SOS i can only say that . EOS
SOS so , if you think somebody 's going to think about this : i want to point out my part , i 've had a idea of the same character or i 've done a lot of time or whatever it is , whatever , that 's already EOS . EOS
SOS you 've got on the web . EOS
SOS on facebook . EOS
SOS great , i 'll be talking to speak . EOS
SOS yes , i do n't want that . EOS
SOS welcome : can you be able to throw memories ? EOS
SOS ask them . EOS
SOS can we form memories ? EOS
SOS can you remember everything that happens in your life ? EOS
SOS have you forgotten yet yet ? EOS
SOS who can remember who else ? EOS
SOS they do n't walk hands up . EOS
SOS so can we form memories ? EOS
SOS it seems to be funny . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS no , we do n't want to do it today . EOS
SOS then the talk would be quite short . EOS
SOS again , little evening , my name is samuel levine . EOS . EOS
SOS i 'm going to give you the talk today , which i took myself because he 's two of my passions or my two big passions . EOS
SOS i 've looked at mit here , and i 've just studied with these pieces , and i 'm dealing with the bits , as big as the world . EOS
SOS and in fact , what 's a time of time is i 'm also as a professional and professional and professional field on the ground . EOS
SOS so one of the page i 've been doing with the computer is a lot to the other side of the right now , i 'm at the moment in human history , so how does that all this thing ? EOS
SOS how can we change that ? EOS
SOS it 's about two and a half . EOS
SOS i 've been in a very interesting talk about artificial intelligence , which is the name language . EOS
SOS so the question was : when can we build a computer that works like the human brain ? EOS
SOS so , i guess we are pretty close to that . EOS
SOS so i would like to think about it , three hundred years more than that . EOS
SOS but let me ask you why you might need that . EOS
SOS so the relationship between the computer on one side and our brains on the other side . EOS
SOS if we take the computer , it 's all right , so you create , you know , your computer , your shirt , and also these cameras , and all of these smart views are somewhere somewhere on your little chip . EOS
SOS it is called central , central to the globe . EOS
SOS these pieces are made by little transistors . EOS
SOS the word has already heard about it , and it 's always been looking like this . EOS
SOS it 's going to signal the very small device , which has three years old , and you can use the same stream or not . EOS
SOS in our computer in our ecosystems we have , i took four hundred million of these small parts . EOS
SOS and the air falls out there . EOS
SOS we 're going to do things , we can calculate things , we 've seen more about einstein 's name , yes , can computers can get anything very much , very quickly , but actually , it can only compare zero and one . EOS
SOS it ca n't . EOS
SOS he 's actually quite jolly . EOS
SOS let 's now want to compare it to our brains . EOS
SOS our brains have a tiny unit of the neuron , the trees , and we have it , and we 've got a hundred billion billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray mass here . EOS
SOS but the beauty here is , our neurons , not only three connections , but they have the same connections to build per gas . EOS
SOS and this is what 's going to be a smooth video of , just because it 's beautiful , is 10 trillion . EOS
SOS that 's 10 to 14 hours . EOS
SOS so , there 's the complexity of our brains as much higher than what we 're currently currently with computers . EOS
SOS if we want to compare the line , maybe one or another , of the first cloned , the first cloned , they had their own power , and they would stand with it , and at the end of the conversation , we were going to EOS on campus . EOS
SOS we also need to do our local course , but the box here is about 20 watts of the diameter . EOS
SOS and that 's what 's happened , and that 's the equivalent of two big bananas , so you do n't need them , and you put your back up there . EOS
SOS now , if we 're going to get a big good part of this up here , the first good computer computer with us , why do n't we use that , why do we forget things ? EOS
SOS maybe one or another one of them on the web : the person is using only 10 percent of the brain , they 're going to buy this flow to being brain brain . EOS
SOS and in addition to the advertising there is a little bit . EOS
SOS ten percent may be perhaps , but our brains is in the process of our evolution to this crowd , which is , in the middle of the middle , we 're going to put in the middle of our buses , everything else has been formed up . EOS
SOS that 's not going to happen because we do n't use that . EOS
SOS why does it seem to be the biggest part of it ? EOS
SOS maybe you know the term of the dopamine ? EOS
SOS i 'm talking about one of the things that i 'm going to see if you look at the moon , in the sea , it 's going to be the top , the sun comes down , down the surface , down the surface . EOS . EOS
SOS and that ten percent , that 's roughly what our minds , our mind , but the only thing is , running a huge drop of ab , the tail . EOS
SOS and we started to think about how we 're going to talk about our future . we 're going to build our current slow process . EOS
SOS and in order to come back to this memory , maybe one or other people had memory . EOS
SOS people who suddenly remember a lot more detail than i did n't see in the situation , and then i would tell you , i said , `` well , how do you know ? EOS
SOS that 's where there 's all , there 's a special sign of a call , which is someone on the smallest town , someone who 's likely to be in a field , which is an expert , who has a massive sign of paper , which is going on in a plane , in a plane , in an airplane , in a helicopter , in a helicopter so fast EOS EOS
SOS and that 's not something like this , and there 's no , no , every single house , every single door he has seen every single window , he could bring it back . EOS
SOS now where does this come from now ? EOS
SOS so why is that why we ca n't do that now , well , now , now , that may be very close to close to the fact that the more high access to its own percent has left . EOS
SOS now we 're using the case , but why ca n't i remember the last night night , in all details ? EOS
SOS now , negroponte grier has interesting experiences of me . EOS
SOS he once worked for an example of work , and he was working with a team who had changed their experience completely , which was no longer going to be the case of the brain that did n't happen , that 's gone . EOS
SOS well , that 's very well clear . EOS
SOS now it 's about making people think . EOS
SOS now , there 's a very safe meeting to the end or after that event , even if you could n't remember that person , then you could recognize the owner of the car that these people had n't EOS
SOS and in fact , with that note of one of the cases . EOS
SOS the second thing i found was that he had had a lady in the editor , who told her mother in her mother in her reading when she was young , so four years . EOS
SOS she sat on her mother 's her mother , and her mother was read . EOS
SOS and then he told her it , in a sense , again . EOS
SOS and then she starts out , she was four than that 's happened , she could n't read that back today . EOS
SOS and then she told me he told me the children . EOS
SOS they actually have a copy of hal in orbit where there 's right on that side of the text that lady read . EOS
SOS so the brain has this page as it was as she did , as an image . EOS
SOS and then you can read it . EOS
SOS so yes , we 've actually got access to it , but we seem to say that we 're in ordinary life , we 're going to have to say , in normal life , not too . EOS
SOS now we may not be looking at that event , but as we said , he has a picture of this picture , one , one of the things we feel , we 're going to store our senses , which we feel what we feel , if you hear EOS
SOS and it was now a long evening ago , but they 're going to take place apart , `` ha , '' i 'm going to walk away , and then i 'll ask you to just do one evening , just close your eyes . EOS
SOS and remember a very , positive event in the modern past , yes . EOS
SOS take the first story . EOS
SOS and if you do that now , you may be aware that you can get a visual piece of it . EOS
SOS you might get a picture , maybe even a movie ? EOS
SOS it 's not only because we 're going to do that normal , but that 's what they 're doing for the first time . EOS
SOS and if you can see that , it can either be in the movie , they either have a screen out of their eyes , or their eyes on a screen . EOS
SOS that 's one of the things we call it . EOS
SOS thank you so much , you 're allowed to solve the thoughts again . EOS
SOS who has a visual information going on , up ? EOS
SOS yes , there 's a couple of hands up there , which is , as soon as i 'd say , yes , that 's kind of what i expected , it 's actually something we do n't think about the very first EOS
SOS well , go on . EOS
SOS so , as a matter of memories , as well , when you make memories , it 's not just those memory that you 're not just looking at these memory , to get rid of a positive event , and i 've seen one or the other smile , there 's EOS also with our memories EOS
SOS and now you get something interesting . EOS
SOS now , all of that was before , well , the brain makes no difference difference in the place no difference between what we actually have and what we 're going to do . EOS
SOS and you can test that if you sit at your home and look at something in the future that 's not happening , you 're going to get similar information like something that 's happened in the past . EOS
SOS and , you know , you know these stories , which is sort of telling these stories , from then . EOS
SOS back then , hey , there 's something that 's happening , and that was so beautiful , and the longer these stories , you know , the stories , the more beautiful , mostly the stories , yeah , there 's a lot higher more romantic , and there 's EOS
SOS so if we 've done that in all the time , when we actually change our memories around , why do n't we try to do that because , i ask you ? EOS
SOS as i came here , my uncle uncle is a picture of his flock in switzerland . EOS
SOS a very nice picture , it 's also a very beautiful divergence . EOS
SOS it 's just that image is a little bit more beautiful than the animal , so it 's emotional liberty , he told me , there 's a picture of it taken off , because it 's a beautiful dog , and it 's a beautiful dog , that 's a picture of that EOS
SOS and why do n't we go about our own thoughts , our own memories , you know , what does it mean to me , if i do that more beautiful , what i think ? EOS
SOS they actually have conventional freedom in their own thoughts . EOS
SOS and you know , by the way , you know , that 's how many people who are watching you in the morning if you just have empty eyes , what 's going on ? EOS
SOS i was bad , i went all the way through the head . EOS
SOS really , really the whole night , and i thought , no longer . EOS
SOS i do n't think it 's the other way away . EOS . EOS
SOS the son of my son 's friend of watching me almost depressed when he came to germany because his mother was in hong england , and he 's just terrible . EOS
SOS what father did , he took every night with the son , and said , or asked , `` well , what was the most beautiful thing going on today ? EOS
SOS what was the most beautiful thing , and he 's going to tell him how to do it , has it exactly what 's going on today . EOS
SOS and within two weeks , the son went through . EOS
SOS and then it was , ok , that 's the food path that comes back to visit again . EOS
SOS and the reason is that the whole youth has been done about this , which is now one of the people i know . EOS
SOS so these are not the memories that affect us where we are , but it is our focus on what we 're using . EOS
SOS and how much energy we use or use it . EOS
SOS so , if you think about it in your daily thoughts , or say , that 's what you 've now , that 's like , `` i 'm so , '' but do n't really like that , but i do n't think about it , but look like that . EOS
SOS so , what we do is we do n't like that , well , ah , what 's nice , you 're looking at there , you know , that 's what i like , i mean , i like , man , that was beautiful , right ? EOS
SOS and then they take that . EOS
SOS take that out to you , and let 's do it . EOS
SOS or if you print somebody else 's shoes , it 's your boss or your wife , or your husband , your husband , you laugh . EOS
SOS so , take a picture , you take a funny hat on it . EOS
SOS if you 're going to sleep on your background , you walk in the background , you 're laughing , you laugh , why are you laughing ? EOS
SOS because they 're thinking because of that thought are funny . EOS
SOS and they can do a lot better with the situation . EOS
SOS so can any memory form ? EOS
SOS no , i think our brains have so much capacity that it can store everything . EOS
SOS but it does n't matter , because we can choose to choose free , how strong the focus and how important we think of that event , a memory , a thought of something that comes to us . EOS
SOS and i 'll tell you , you 're playing with the pictures in your head , you 're using the power of your mouth , and you give it every day that your life needs . EOS
SOS yeah . EOS
SOS thank you for the invitation . EOS
SOS when i asked me to a party and i 'm going to do so in my spare time and i talk about playing together with friends , with friends , and i 'm going to see color eyes , and in my head of my audience , the EOS
SOS if i zoom in it , there 's a kind of classic music for classical music , and then it turns out to these types of thousands of old people who are just sitting in just long life , and really focused in art . EOS
SOS frank kelley said to talk about music as well as thinking about architecture . EOS
SOS and so similarly , that 's what we do . EOS
SOS so that 's what i 'm going to talk about now , i made a short film . EOS
SOS i 'm going to
SOS in fact , that 's what 's written on the air . EOS
SOS it takes me the best point to the point . EOS
SOS since then we 've been growing from a very sophisticated point of the way they do something completely different . EOS
SOS we 've had a ph.d. , today we are from arkansas and middle , at the end of the 20th age , and we 've seen very early in our youth , which is incredible strength and joy . EOS
SOS but we also have experienced that as well as well as well as we give us some joy , you know , a little bit . EOS
SOS and we are aware of the fact that the so-called crisis of the classical music is not to the content , so it 's on your heel . EOS
SOS so we ask the question , how can we create a charter that the music is close , the friends and the power that we like it . EOS
SOS how can we organize a process that goes beyond the formation of the detector ? EOS
SOS we 're going to ask the distribution that you 've seen from the classical concert , space , time , light , context , basically . EOS
SOS let 's take the relationship between knowledge and musicians . EOS
SOS normally there is between the stage and the audience is a gap . EOS
SOS we 're trying to try and do that . EOS
SOS this is a picture of our favorites . EOS
SOS the musicians are sitting in the audience , called beer , they 're going to be able to play up , play one , two pieces , they are in the audience . EOS
SOS the whole thing is going to happen in the course of the evening . EOS
SOS anybody who 's attracted to it is coming on the stage and goes back . EOS
SOS or you 're sitting in the concert . EOS
SOS in the classic book , it 's so much more comfortable or less comfortable , more attractive , as much as you can see here , sitting in here and listening . EOS
SOS but there 's some music , because you ca n't stand still . EOS
SOS and we 've thought how to do that . EOS
SOS if you sit in a different way , you can go to a long piece of music , then you hear laughter differently . EOS
SOS here 's another thing that we did n't have a stage for that concert , and it 's four degrees around the audience . EOS
SOS the audience was going to recover . EOS
SOS so on the evening , everyone in the front row . EOS
SOS important for us is that we do n't just make any difference , but we think of the music . EOS
SOS so we ask ourselves , however , what are the spaces , but also in the minds of the people need the music to be able to work as they work ? EOS ? EOS
SOS and so at night at the end of night , at the end of the year , four miles ago , the average of all , only being eaten by are protected , in tokyo , in tokyo , in tokyo , in old . EOS
SOS but not only the spaces around the spaces and the lighting can fly to the music and the other things , but also the connection to others . EOS
SOS and so we 're totally happy that we 've been working on a couple of years working with the kids who are trying to work with us , or movements , who actually did n't have to dance . EOS
SOS and so then they 're going to run on to be the case for example of clay or for manufacturing of steve . EOS
SOS and in that year we 've got one , if you want to be like that . EOS
SOS we took the first time a concert together . EOS . EOS
SOS we 've had the story of the soldiers from the soldiers of children 's offices , with dream , flop , flying , and also putting them down to a pile . EOS
SOS but that 's pretty much about this , because we had a very large breakthrough that has given us in that piece . EOS
SOS we 've gotten a lot of money from people from all over germany , so that we could do that . EOS
SOS there 's nothing that comes out of a community . EOS
SOS we are totally happy to have a home in the home of video at home . EOS
SOS so the city is exactly so large that we find great spaces and exciting places to find new , but also as small as we know . EOS
SOS in fact , when the beginning of the year of the year two weeks from the city of europe is in the city , it just turns out that in the city , there are more people in the city . EOS
SOS the whole thing is being organized . EOS
SOS we 're proposing , a sharp mixture of students and students , in finance , on the other , as well , , really entirely entirely smooth . EOS
SOS and to give up one of a sudden that 's going to get so , you know , and to get away in the eye , it 's seven to 10 to 10 pounds in a pouch for a year . EOS
SOS but it turns out , but they also take a long time for example , for example , or the kidney , or the kidney , which is going to be in the same hands , and by the way it 's organized . EOS
SOS we are doing all of this in our daily lives and life throughout germany . EOS
SOS that means that the biggest part of the work is going to put it out and put on a pan . EOS
SOS only three times in the year we are meeting us over the year , to a quarter of summer , missouri , talks that one or other problems that have come up , and also the other thing that is just relevant , if you want to EOS
SOS and then finally , 20 to 30 volunteers , then they come up to a few days or a few weeks , or a few weeks of their hands , and because of their aid , in the end of their hand , as opposed , as opposed , as opposed . EOS
SOS and of course , in those days , the musicians are coming up . EOS
SOS now you could need me to do everything you need a little bit like this . EOS . EOS
SOS but our continued goes on . EOS
SOS we 've also been building a large community in the city of a large community around us to what we want to do . EOS
SOS that 's what comes from the classic path , which is also about very practical things for example , where we have a vision that connects us with bread , or a metabolism that takes us fresh food . EOS
SOS so this is going to be translated into a residential city in the city over the entire year and sold . EOS
SOS to go down to the balcony . EOS
SOS we found a whole bunch of individuals that can allow us to build their living living together so that the musicians can get there . EOS
SOS and in this way , the stereotype has been put into a little bit of the same city and of the people in this city . EOS
SOS they identify in a very particular way with this kind of surgery . EOS
SOS since the beginning of the year , we 've been able to call the local support of the people in the local place , which is now now that the whole thing was going on to work on a sustainable store . EOS
SOS we fought from the process of life , that classical music is failing , it comes into the right hands . EOS
SOS so we 're incredibly happy about that , in fact , in europe , young music music , in their own hands , in their own hands , and home in the cities . EOS
SOS now , if you still ca n't imagine as well , as you feel like this , classical music is going to experience , you just come over . EOS
SOS the next year we 're back again , and we would be happy if they were there . EOS
SOS yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn . EOS
SOS you may think of yourself . EOS
SOS you know , to learn how to learn about the effect of learning , but i mean , there 's a lot more to learning , which is also going to be able to collect more and more productive , and that 's what we 're going to win . EOS
SOS well , even an experience of life , which is a beautiful formula for the order . EOS . EOS
SOS what i 've learned from art and culture is now , there 's a lot of , of course , because now you 're going to carry food on this field . EOS
SOS and that 's why i 've been thinking that maybe it might be really true to give this thing a little bit more , a different thing , which my talk . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS art is beautiful , but a lot of work . EOS
SOS they also laugh . EOS
SOS you 're always going to hear the same though that most people know the same . EOS
SOS why is that ? EOS
SOS i think that 's what we can do with that in the word . EOS
SOS art , that 's just telling us sometimes that . EOS
SOS in the process , we 're going to tell that , that 's what . EOS
SOS sometimes again . EOS
SOS the people who likes to work , that 's what to me . EOS
SOS but in the process , we 're going to think of that , and in the art of art , we 're going to think about the rich parts of the network , where we move into it , our experiences , our experiences . EOS our experiences . EOS
SOS and so i 've been talking to my life that i 'd like to share with you about three hours in five categories that have all the kind of words , with one i just starts to think about it . EOS
SOS it starts with the interaction for childhood , which is continuing to inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not going to worry about my youth , not a worry , i 'm going to talk about why i 've taken that EOS . EOS
SOS the interaction for the first part of my professional life , and finally , five , a little bit . EOS
SOS one of them will be able to know these pieces of over a hundred hundred . EOS
SOS it 's round , it 's like , two and zeros .
SOS you learn that in the first two three years , three years old , you learn something else , and i 'm going to quickly . EOS
SOS and so with 10 , 11 , i played these little pieces on the piano , not from here , at home . EOS . EOS
SOS these are pieces of a millimeter . EOS
SOS there 's a tune there , and the other voice , but it 's very different . EOS
SOS the rhythm is right now , but it 's tiring . EOS
SOS and that , ladies and gentlemen , is a little bit of art in art that it 's true , and if there is only two voices , they go together together , together , if that 's the present , the future , that makes art art . EOS
SOS and i 've learned about two and sometimes , sometimes three , to play , to play in the same time , at the same time , at the same time , any way to hear , to hear any of these things , not to hear others . EOS
SOS that 's what i 've learned there . EOS
SOS another experience i 've never forgotten , and i 've never forgotten that i might have been able to go like this . EOS
SOS i got piano in the room , there were more people in the room than today , and in that i came out . EOS
SOS i had forgotten it . EOS
SOS i played it back . EOS
SOS so again , from the beginning , again , i 'm not going to work again . EOS
SOS the audience is more than me , because i went to my place , brought my notes , put it back and started the third time . EOS
SOS and you do n't think about how the tea are . EOS
SOS but that was a very heavy experience . EOS
SOS maybe one of the experience i knew was where i knew , well , with the piano , even though i was going to go quickly quickly , i would n't walk my career because you can cheat easier . EOS
SOS yes , the next chapter of my team , i 've been working with inspiration , and i want to tell you stories . EOS
SOS when i was being so far , i went to my talk , and i told him to be mr. , i 'd like to play a play . EOS
SOS and he said , `` hey , that 's not . EOS
SOS there 's a whole lot of parties , and there 's been a lot of experience with women . EOS
SOS now imagine a very young guy , so young , a sentence . EOS
SOS i did n't forget that . EOS
SOS and of course , i 'm obviously going to work even more . EOS
SOS now in the process , i was in the way , and i was in a fellowship . EOS
SOS i 've looked at mit , and i remember a situation i 've never experienced before . EOS
SOS it was the master from the chopin , and now i 'm now going to come to the part of my work , i just did n't want it out , and it was the most beautiful place , and it was the most beautiful place , and then it went back and EOS
SOS i ca n't be able to play it now , not a piano here , and i could n't . EOS
SOS i took this down 20 , 30 times in a row , and suddenly it came right . EOS
SOS and then i went and i played them on and i left , and i fell in love with a furniture , and i still only know that i was suddenly interested in the ground and laughing . EOS
SOS i was out of myself . EOS
SOS i had nothing wrong with nothing , and i had nothing left , and the music was done with me . EOS
SOS an experience i learned is that emotions are really useful . EOS
SOS and sometimes it 's true to work in order to work in that category , in that condition , i call it . EOS
SOS wherever everything is going on . EOS
SOS we actually had this situation , actually , then in the diaspora , in an organization . EOS
SOS it was almost anything like himself when we made it all over a couple months , where you would need to need a year for it . EOS
SOS now , these were my experiences with the piano , with my labor work . EOS
SOS and now i 'm going to come to my shop , jane . EOS
SOS i was first once as a musician , but as a result . EOS
SOS we 've done something played up , we 're going to speak . EOS
SOS i 've taken over , and i 've been able to get out to my way for the music and that would have been . EOS
SOS in choir , in addition to breathe , one of these , wonderful experiences that i really have very , very focused . EOS . EOS
SOS and then a point where i went to theater as an atheist of the dodo theater , which is going to go into the lobby , and the function of the economy , and i 've been talking about this chapter , and this chapter , because that 's when i came up with this idea , and that idea came from this combination of art , EOS
SOS that 's what art has to allow to do that . EOS
SOS so here 's work for art , but not just as an artist , but otherwise , you know , you 're not going to speak to it , but you 're going to go down and continue to do something . EOS
SOS i was there in theater , and i 've been documenting there in germany , there was no , in germany , only in 1982 , there i left , and i 've always been here about this question , what can you do to improve art , what can you do to improve art , in germany , in order to help build the foundation of art , in germany , in order to help build EOS EOS
SOS and that was the reason why i 've been working in my career , in the direction of this talk , and with that time , i was going to quit it . EOS
SOS but before that was another , and this time , i was working with interaction . EOS
SOS now , i came up to the germans . EOS
SOS the german railway has his head rate in sumatra . EOS
SOS i 'm a psychologist , though , sometimes in my inbox , because i was born in my 20s , i always think i 've been born with , you know , i 'm born , i 'll have it somehow . EOS
SOS but i 've got a deeper root , because my grandparents , i 've also been also covered , and there i have seen the translation . EOS
SOS that was what i did n't think so much , and suddenly i became hidden in a different form of culture , into a file zone , in a culture that has been lived from people in this mysterious device . EOS
SOS as soon as we went to us , everybody in a very different situation , in very different conditions . EOS
SOS and i was going to talk to you with the olympics of the future and i 'm going to leave you to be called the friend and my colleague , and then we 've gone out for the last night , and he was playing , i mean i 'd played another EOS
SOS we 've made the muir , so , of course , on the other hand , we went to sleep . EOS
SOS and this man came out of the people . EOS
SOS it was my destiny that i was running on december november to my apartment , and i did n't even feel like the wall fell . EOS
SOS i live on the next day , i had painted , oh , the wall is like , yes . EOS
SOS i 've come up with it for any questions to the end . EOS
SOS and there i was , for the urban city in the 1960s . EOS . EOS
SOS and as i 've seen again , how interaction like interactions between two german cultures . EOS
SOS in fact , we 're talking about the same language , the music becomes a wonderful thing , and it was wonderful , but a lot of it was wasted , as well . EOS
SOS unlike the storm , it did n't come from all the people , but it came to a lot of the top , and that 's what i 've been as a great , big experience , to experience this , of course , like the german identity , and then i 'd go back and back EOS , and then EOS , these two states EOS
SOS since then , germany is happening . EOS
SOS since then , there 's also a lot of more time on the ground . EOS
SOS but in interaction , i 've learned all things here and experience in the city . EOS
SOS we used to do this , by the way that i had , by the way , and imagine that as i was here today , here it was at my point of culture and play . EOS
SOS i have that . EOS
SOS for example , if you were stood for you , you did n't want to write about write for the culture of the culture and
SOS i was the first director of the flight . EOS . EOS
SOS so i do n't have a lot of time that , but anyway , that was wonderful to me , but they would go soon because i was in education for education , and to build that . EOS
SOS we 've done a lot of work for the urban crisis , and we 've only seen this thing between death , as we look down , and as we can see what we 've designed to do , which is going to experience , how to experience , where you can experience interactions between art and architecture , from EOS to the blue rock . EOS
SOS many , many interactions , we could build and i 've experienced , and i 've experienced what that means when different people come together from different areas together . EOS
SOS and what i notice is that i 'm more and more of the art of art , more and more to the culture of art , which is that the whole race between people , between people , between cultures , between communities , and i come back to art . EOS
SOS interaction was also the way the way that we were going to be , as we were , as we were , seven , seven , had the idea , on december january , which was going on to be the case of europe . EOS
SOS but this last chapter , this fifth chapter has yet made a story . EOS . EOS
SOS now this word has two choices , one i 'm going to do with something , so i can use it as verb , and i say , `` i 've got something that is , i know something . EOS
SOS and in fact , always in his self-interest . EOS
SOS i know something with his fingertips , which is why i 've got it , or the community or the community . EOS
SOS and i started with something that i 'm going to tell you about this , and i 'm saying that i 'd heard to you with that . EOS
SOS and that 's a very big deal . EOS
SOS five of them three million people are trying to move , to identify , to identify , to identify , to identify in the same sense , to look at and realize that one community is in europe . EOS
SOS as big , we 've called it as big , but anyway , as a community of many people who live in a big walkable life , and yet , at least a common language , there are also a common language , even if there are people here , and this was our EOS
SOS in signs , for example of the highway , many other experiences . EOS
SOS there 's a experience that you have n't seen so many people . EOS
SOS so , there 's a way of traveling food and food , two schools , worked , young girls from the year , and young students from a school school , with the letters of a school school , with letters of people who were EOS , young men , from a play home waiting at home , EOS
SOS and it was a remarkable effect that young girl used to buy letters from young , and young leaders then letters from young men from germany into something . EOS
SOS and there was one of those young men who went to the piano , and she played this platform that i loved . EOS
SOS and then , from a letter and said , i 'm a blogger , he wrote him home , when young german , he played a play , and i ca n't give you a ride , because my two fingers are just EOS
SOS and he was leaving his fingers with a camera , put back up to the piano , trying to play his fingers . EOS
SOS and it did n't . EOS
SOS it was such an anomaly that i 've got home , and said , what did we learn ? EOS
SOS we 've learned that many people can move together , but we 've learned from all sorts of things , we learned that we lived in in peace with peace and the culture of culture that we are not going to move the head because we 're not going to identify the EOS
SOS and that was an amazing experience , and you can see , it 's not just about something . EOS
SOS it 's always about learning to experience something and to win . EOS
SOS and if we can prevent a lot of rules and invention , if we let it to allow us to inspire ourselves from art and culture , our own position in the conversation of the work , as we interact , and ultimately in our own designs to work together by working with art and culture , all of us EOS
SOS and i hope you 've got lots of thousands of years ago , and i 'm hoping you 're going to pull this out . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS yeah , thank you very much . EOS
SOS i think we 'll wait for the first picture . EOS
SOS so i 've got to close to the support of my child here so some slides . EOS
SOS but there are no scientific slides here , but it 's in my thinking here , looking at a place here , and i 'm going to talk to a theme of where i think we 'll spend the next few years . EOS
SOS by the time words , i 've finally experienced a lot very much about what ted means , and i think , in the process , we can create this talk . EOS
SOS and then i 've heard the talk of english , if somehow , if somehow , but if you look at it , you can see , you would n't understand , you would n't understand what i would say to english , i did n't know how to EOS
SOS as we die . EOS
SOS i 've got to tell you about a couple of people . EOS
SOS in fact , patient was a patient in the hospital where i was going to get rid of the way , and i was thrown down . EOS
SOS she was about 7,000 years old , and it always would like to fall in may , because she remembered her husband , who was the first man who was doing in war . EOS
SOS and so it 's done every year for the first time ever to dance , and for a long time , and then it 's likely to have a record like that too much , and then it 's going down , and it turns out , and here on the right-hand side , you can see that EOS
SOS a few years before it has been around , and it had a lot of years before , with the same reason the left leg . EOS
SOS and then i was also there as a doctor , and i 've been as a physician , and as she was in the training care , as she was treated with antibiotics , was also taken , and as a result of how it was said , because that does EOS
SOS does it make sense of an old man doing such as an intuitive tool ? EOS
SOS so in fact , for example , in order for the sake of weeks , is this one person at all ? EOS
SOS and it 's been clear . EOS
SOS five years later i go to the clinic , look at the name of this name , and i can remember it because it 's so rare , even for the time in the clinic , and the dance has broken off the dance . EOS
SOS so the question is , what do i actually do when i talk about how to decide how to decide what he write up in his head or what he also does ? EOS
SOS and that 's a little bit about the theme of the subject . EOS
SOS you can see the flow of the book as we die . EOS
SOS it 's a book from how we 're going to work , a report to the balcony . EOS
SOS and then at that time , it was so much that the globalization has been so strong , so that you 've asked , how could it go to work ? EOS
SOS you 've got it , and you can also read this in this book , just as i said , it 's going to come up with your brain so that the parts are coming together . EOS
SOS it 's going to take a sense of work , and it 's going to become much more powerful than the job , for example , to china , which was a big deal at that time . EOS
SOS and then that 's true basically the work of the individual thing , so something that is made of something that has been increasingly controlled by the quality of the quality of the quality of it . EOS
SOS and that , after all , to my surprise , that people would take less and less and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more of a small
SOS and if we apply that in the gulf and medical medical area , then there 's a design development . EOS
SOS in fact , if you hear a television on tv , what doctors and women are , most of them , most of them , then they 're called what 's called the page . EOS
SOS and that does n't mean anything else than this is what you 've done is what you 've done is that it 's going to be paid at all , and if it 's not that it 's paid , then the medical service also , then the medical service also , or this medical treatment , we do n't pay EOS
SOS and by that same thing , the work of the time is becoming increasingly and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more '' to do that , in the background , as a result of life
SOS now , a good friend of mine went to the street because he did n't want this anymore because he did n't want it anymore , who had a kind of internal practice , and then she gave up , and he went home to become a doctor 's doctor . EOS
SOS now , if you think about these trends , there 's a little bit at the same time , and it had , `` martin , '' had seen that there were always more old people who are running between the left , the hospital , and back , because the dodgers did n't know what to do if it went EOS
SOS and then they come into the hospital , they 're going to go back to the local home , or two , and they 're going to get there . EOS
SOS and that family had just been thinking about if there is such a little bit thing in the back here , and then i would like to invite myself to a way to bring up here , so i 'd like to make you a little bit here that you can also talk from this cartoon EOS EOS . EOS
SOS now , in the u.k. , he actually had to find out he 'd learned language , he had exactly the same thing that was going on in this conversation . EOS
SOS it 's going to become increasingly increasingly as a result . EOS
SOS it 's not much more likely to count that , but you 're in a position , i do n't want to be rude , for example , or not even in the hospital if i 'm in a coma . EOS
SOS and then the paradox becomes . EOS
SOS in arabic , it 's in the third days , the third day , a conversation is going to be the case , and you have to figure out , i want to go to the hospital or i do n't want to be in the hospital if something happens . EOS
SOS that 's exactly what i want to be done , or i do n't want to be compassionate . EOS
SOS and that data is going to go to a central line , and there 's this doctor 's physician for children , has always gone up and hold the decision on this basis . EOS
SOS now , if we look at that level , which has happened to be seen in may , and we also imagine that i would have written a letter , which would n't experience a letter , i would n't experience it . EOS
SOS and that 's what my friend 's friend , who 's sitting in here , also as much as he should . EOS
SOS in the last last , it 's so much that today 's about five percent of the deaths , not home , but in hospitals , in hospitals , in hospitals , in hospitals , and in hospitals , and in hospitals , they also do the sense , so you can also think of this , not the ideal EOS
SOS there are very high school who are very well very well , there are very many people who are looking at it , but if i look at the distance , and we have about two patients in the year , so about five and his EOS
SOS now , the whole thing of course , of course , has been very compelling reasons , which is very clear , this whole , all over control of control , because the last money is n't enough for all the people and to feed a family of children with one or two . EOS
SOS now this is simply not the reality ; it takes us to take two kilograms and push it down , and it 's often only time . EOS
SOS this notion of learning as a result of light as a result of light is constantly growing the market that you really want to get in the individual . EOS
SOS and now i 'm going to show you how to get away from it , so what we do now , in the last last time , because i 've asked you a question , and i 'm going to have it very simple for people . EOS
SOS and i just took it to the end and i wrote the article to me because i think a society also needs so structures to grow up with these structures , also physical structures where we EOS the whole thing that happens in our society . EOS
SOS and in fact it 's what you saw about it , which is the human man 's dignity . EOS
SOS and the second sentence here is to protect them , is to protect them at least . EOS
SOS and what i sometimes is , is another third sentence in there , that every single one was true of the assignment to protect its dignity , to protect . EOS
SOS because that 's a path of taking yourself out of that event , and i 'm going to give it to other other ways , and i 'm going to die in other ways , and then i 'm not going to make any thinking about it . EOS
SOS because the last thing is , even if we do n't like this , we will come to the point here . EOS
SOS hopefully only wait with a hundred or a half . EOS
SOS so that 's very much , of course , to tell me that i want everybody to do , and i want to worry , but at some point , you 'll have to be late in life , and if it is that far , if you 're going to think about this question EOS
SOS now , if you think about it , what do i mean , then you will get on the dots , where then last , what are the five of the five things in my life ? EOS
SOS there 's a book which is quite valid . EOS
SOS it 's the anonymous , of course , it 's the friends i have , which i 'm talking to talk about , which i know , and i can know this by the life of the life , and it 's the holidays . EOS
SOS it 's certainly the trust between people that i might be able to do with that , or in the middle circle or a sports or a or another person with which i 'm playing with relationship . EOS
SOS and there are many , of course , there are many , of course , which are running , i 'm not going to go through that . EOS
SOS but if you look at these three points , they 've already had a whole bunch of jobs to protect in their lives in life . EOS
SOS and then then there 's another factor of doing that we see a certain kind of neuron of the time , and i 've seen this one as a text or as an example of it . EOS
SOS other people can make these decisions , and this behavior , which , not meet . EOS . EOS
SOS that 's my inner belief . EOS
SOS we can only get our dignity out of ourselves . EOS
SOS so it 's not the question , what will others do for me , who will give me a time for me for me , or to me , who 's going to me ? EOS
SOS but it 's exactly the same way to ask , where can i move to people where i can get myself in my mind , and i would get my inner dignity , and i can get this questions , and i can do it . EOS
SOS and then when you say how we work , you know , these deep spots being from the outside , there is a way to say , `` my inner inner dignity would be able to escape this mechanism . EOS
SOS because no human can tell me how i myself myself , because you want to see me . EOS
SOS and i do n't have to believe that in general , or say , say you 've got to have a film now , and because you 've got that age , you 're wondering exactly whether you want to be more than you 're going to want to want to vote . EOS
SOS these are the questions i can only use for a long , probably long . EOS
SOS this would be a inner posture that is in me and not by the way that the state can not protect , nor the state can not protect , nor the law to me , and i 'm going to get more and more , if i 've just gotten EOS
SOS and in order to run these conversations , it takes spaces , and i think , and i 've heard this talk from this talk , and this is kind of showing me these spaces like this , in food , which i 've been here to show you here in a picture EOS
SOS so with that , if we are old , you can say , well , that 's kind of like a dance , despite my very high , that 's even what . EOS
SOS i thank you very much for your attention . EOS
SOS beautiful good evening . EOS
SOS i 'll give you two things . EOS
SOS if you look at the first part of the flat , you 'll have a little bit more . '' EOS
SOS there 's another second one . EOS
SOS let 's start with the humor . EOS
SOS that 's stupid , it 's not . EOS
SOS what do you mean ? EOS
SOS are there different types of death ? EOS
SOS or is serious enough ? EOS
SOS yes ! EOS
SOS that 's not good when this one is about what 's going on . EOS
SOS so , in fact , i 'll give it down to the people who know it . EOS
SOS that 's exactly what we 're not doing . EOS
SOS we 're only dealing with one . EOS
SOS and i 'd like to get it back a bit . EOS
SOS if we , we 've known , we seem to know a little bit . EOS
SOS and it 's going to be the case for tens of thousands of dna . EOS
SOS if we were in the jungle on the board , and we count two of them , one of the things in which other people . EOS
SOS we know , imagine now , we look into the box in the box , the number is small , it 's three , and it 's three people . EOS
SOS we can check out how many of the number elements inside ? EOS ? EOS
SOS how would we do it ? EOS
SOS that is , we 'd just get people like this , one , two , three , we get three , we get the three , we count the three , we see three , two , three , three , three three and wonderful . EOS
SOS you mean , yes ? EOS
SOS very beautiful . EOS
SOS and this works in pretty much amazing numbers , which is also working at large numbers , even though it is . EOS
SOS but it fits . EOS
SOS how can you count it ? EOS
SOS how can we still be able to see that there are so many people sitting there ? EOS
SOS i 've taken it out , and people did n't know what else . EOS
SOS let 's do it ! EOS
SOS you call the mate together . EOS
SOS you all right , that 's clear , not so now we are in the middle of the day , and we 're already trying to understand that . EOS
SOS it 's very beautiful . EOS
SOS so , you also call this a function and it works well , right ? EOS
SOS you take a chair , put a chair out of the mouse . EOS
SOS the next year , the way the next round , everything is all about , different people can get different , no chair are empty , and the fraction of them are equal big , okay ? EOS
SOS now we 're going to go into the infinite scale . EOS
SOS how can we compare two infinite amounts of parallel ? EOS
SOS we would say that one 's the size or bigger or smaller than the other . EOS
SOS we could do it ? EOS
SOS we would start again . EOS
SOS right , that 's wrong , because the point is , if you start to count an infinite amount , yeah , i would just say you wo n't be able to say . EOS
SOS ue , liquid failure , is sure , huh ? EOS
SOS so how is it going ? EOS
SOS chimborazo ? EOS
SOS it 's impossible . EOS
SOS she had done it right ! EOS
SOS mate ! EOS
SOS so now we 're looking at that . EOS
SOS guess if you think that 's a bad deal , yes ? EOS
SOS you see , you see , you see , yeah ? EOS
SOS the point is that you 're very simple . EOS
SOS for example , if i take you , natural numbers , we 're going to have the zero , the zero , zero , two , three , three , five . EOS
SOS and we would say , we 're going to have a copy of this video , and take them from one of those copy of an infinite lot . EOS
SOS the ones are just numbers , okay , zero , four , six , eight , huh ? EOS
SOS okay ? EOS
SOS all the red figures are on the rise of the infinite long band of the natural numbers , but on the one hand , they are missing the brakes , so on the other hand , the straight line , the straight line on the straight line , okay ? EOS
SOS let 's call the crowd of the squares straight , we call the other amount of the natural world . EOS
SOS what do you think ? EOS
SOS is yves more powerful , is it greater than the world , right ? EOS
SOS right ? EOS
SOS but that 's very , very , very , very much , yes , in which you do n't have the diamond . EOS
SOS who is another guess ? EOS
SOS smaller ? EOS
SOS who says bigger ? EOS
SOS ah , they really did n't have any plan , yes ? EOS
SOS it ca n't be , yes ? EOS
SOS you ca n't , where 's missing , you ca n't , that 's not enough ? EOS
SOS okay , they say smaller ? EOS
SOS would you guess , right ? EOS
SOS that 's what you 're like , of course . EOS
SOS and now i 'm now going to explain why they are the same . EOS . EOS
SOS how does it work ? EOS
SOS right . EOS
SOS yes , we mate . EOS
SOS that 's where . EOS
SOS we mate . EOS
SOS we 're taking the zero out of the bubble range , we take the zero out of the natural crowd , they get out . EOS
SOS the next of the zero , after two two , two degrees comes two , after that zero comes one , and i 'll get a meal . EOS
SOS the four , the two , the six , three , four , yes ? EOS
SOS you can also turn it around , and then it 's doubled , which is clear , right ? EOS
SOS and it 's totally clear that we 're going to put it on the next stage . EOS
SOS and here 's one , there 's just the straight line there , and the band is short , right ? EOS
SOS we are leaving the natural straight line , and the ones are taking away , and the band is still the same . EOS
SOS that 's just what 's happening . EOS
SOS so if you explain what we 've learned today , we 've learned learning , yes , what 's happening , i know ? EOS
SOS an infinite amount of fact has a property that is n't in the lift , and this is true , is absolute unacceptable , which is exactly the size . EOS
SOS they do n't do that in the courtyard , if they three three people , there 's only one there , and there were three . EOS
SOS yes , that 's what we did . EOS
SOS is n't there ? EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS then we 're going to take a second part , probability . EOS
SOS the patrollers , the lack of individuals . EOS
SOS here 's what brought up . EOS
SOS in this experiment i 'm sure you 're going to know at least a third , and does it matter someone who has it , right ? EOS
SOS so we call the `` a b , b , c . '' EOS
SOS i hope i 've written behind anything , i hope you 're not heard . EOS
SOS and i want you to guess now . EOS
SOS where , you know , have anything hidden inside , behind a , b or c ? EOS
SOS guess here , our running , here . EOS
SOS you 'll pick up to c . EOS
SOS who has another idea ? EOS
SOS a ? EOS
SOS who has an idea ? EOS
SOS boy , smoke , b has n't , it 's not obvious , otherwise never hear it , right ? EOS
SOS that 's exactly right . EOS
SOS it does n't really matter , so you do n't need to know the three letters , and i 'll give you one . EOS
SOS it 's really no matter , yes ? EOS
SOS it 's totally clear that the chance of happiness is that you 've lucky , you know , only one third . EOS . EOS
SOS boy , there are three things , it does n't really matter , yeah ? EOS
SOS now i 'm going to take this out . i just do one . EOS
SOS well , i know where it is . EOS
SOS so , in addition , this is somebody here has someone here . EOS
SOS so , i know where it is , and the point and the belief or whatever it 's called , goes into a second round . EOS
SOS so i 'm now really now now now i 'm going to talk about now . EOS
SOS so it 's kind of like we go into a second round . EOS
SOS now , hey , i 'll put myself on a a , i guess ? EOS
SOS so now i have to show a door behind which it is n't , and they did n't say it . EOS
SOS because if you say b , and i say , and i know it 's not flat b . EOS
SOS then there would n't be a second round . EOS
SOS i 'll say , `` i 'm going to tell you , the mouse , ok . EOS
SOS but i 've got to say that 's going on the second round . EOS
SOS so i 'm only going to have an eye where it 's not just not but what they did n't say . EOS
SOS now the question is , and that 's probably the probability of the condition here , under the condition of condition that 's open open , and it 's not behind you now , you have your last chance to guess . EOS
SOS you can stay in a run , and i 'll take a look at that . EOS
SOS i 'll do what they want . EOS
SOS or you say i 'm going to make c . EOS
SOS now this is the basis , now , has it been more likely to do with this knowledge ? EOS
SOS osorio , very nice , b is , now i know , it 's behind c . EOS
SOS or , thank god , thank god open 's open , i always wanted to stay with a , that 's it . EOS
SOS or if you 're going to say now , we 've gone off now , we have , you know , we 've only got two doors now , so it 's not going to change or stay . EOS
SOS what do you mean ? EOS
SOS it does n't matter . EOS
SOS morton bast EOS
SOS why is n't it ? EOS
SOS very beautiful . EOS
SOS why is it that ? EOS ? EOS
SOS yes , exactly , that 's wrong . EOS
SOS now that does almost seem almost like we 'd put it yesterday ? EOS
SOS but that 's how it are , you know , it 's a new job , fun . EOS
SOS so , that 's the thing that 's going on , yes . EOS
SOS you know , everyone else knows , i do n't know , six and , yes , i ca n't be more confident , otherwise i 'm not going to have any of it anymore ? EOS
SOS so , it really does . EOS . EOS
SOS behind that door , it 's too third . EOS
SOS and it 's still one third behind a door . EOS
SOS they can guess what they want , they share with two peaks they 're in orbit . EOS
SOS that means you could have two dozen , not that you can do it at the time you can do two dozen , you can put them down to two dozen , you know , if you remove the zero , you 're all in real life . EOS
SOS but here 's only one door . EOS
SOS so now , it 's like , two third is not what you 're going to guess . EOS
SOS so this is two thirds here , but it can only get behind a door ! EOS
SOS it 's not there . EOS
SOS so , what 's more likely to do ? EOS
SOS no , i really stuck it . EOS
SOS so , what 's more likely to do ? EOS
SOS it 's better to remain , or to change ? EOS
SOS now it 's easy , right ? EOS
SOS yes , of course ! EOS
SOS so that 's not hard , right ? EOS
SOS ha ! EOS
SOS what do we see ? EOS
SOS you 've got bored . EOS
SOS why ? EOS
SOS very simple , it 's not a hundred percent : the difference between theory and practice . EOS
SOS i hope it was for everybody . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS mr. gelehun , for example , if you go to l.a. , who 's just eating this talk of bad food and wild food , and people who have noticed that really was completely completely . EOS . EOS . EOS . EOS . EOS . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS but i 'm going to push my best out of the time that all the time is coming back . EOS
SOS i 'm going to come through that i was eating farm , and knew until i was 12 , at least . EOS
SOS that 's kind of going to work right . EOS
SOS i mean . EOS
SOS thanks to the point today . EOS
SOS i grew up here . EOS . EOS
SOS and i do n't know if mr. was also about this because i want to ask myself to wonder if i want to end up to the lake at ted , i want to talk about a particular topic . EOS
SOS i gave him out . i 've confidence that trust . EOS
SOS sure , motivation is n't bad , and i 'm telling you the woman who said , maybe one or another one . EOS
SOS i 'm going to have full of that . EOS
SOS so today i 'm going to do the rain at the rain now now would be a lot , but i have to train tomorrow in the job , because i was in three weeks at the end of this june , where i 'm going to go on to buy a bike car -- that 's EOS
SOS so i do n't leave that morning to rain the training . EOS
SOS so , if you want to , you know , the morning go tomorrow , you know , you know , i 'm not kidding . EOS
SOS i 've already said i 've said , well , i 'm talking to speak about this topic . EOS
SOS and i started talking , `` well , take away . '' EOS
SOS no worry , the nice thing , the same guy , the blind trust . EOS
SOS i was just thinking about it before i am more than , how do i do the best where i was ? EOS
SOS so , i come from a local village with six houses , lots of thousands of years ago , and my parents on the farm is apple 's head , and i 'm talking about it , and what 's going to do : beer . EOS
SOS trust , of course not in sports , of course not with me , you know . EOS and beer . EOS
SOS why would i tell the story where i come from ? EOS
SOS to me , one of the really important stories is that i really am that right away from the country , from the village come with two big brothers with my oldest brother , who 's the name . EOS
SOS and with the second brother , which is very blind as i am . EOS
SOS it 's called the light and dark , and it can also see the where there 's light out in the room , whether it 's light . EOS . EOS
SOS which is very convenient to the home home . EOS
SOS the one , or we can see just when we do anything . EOS
SOS miguel street , but i 'm always saying i ca n't be different , you 're going to get rid of man . EOS
SOS for the first time , the old guys . EOS
SOS it 's always going to be the way up to
SOS and what i 've always been looking at is , of course , is the fact that you trust trust , and you get that big trust , the whole thing that we all need , more than something that we all need , as something that i tell . EOS
SOS and that was my parents , that was like a lot of you , from my brother , and i did n't even know the blind . EOS
SOS we were so the first ones that then suddenly put into their lives . EOS
SOS and then they had something out of the kind of situation . EOS
SOS and now i say , well , it 's a great happiness that my parents as citizens not to stand up next day to stand with us , and to say , there 's a smart wall , where you go along and you can feel where you EOS . EOS
SOS a picture is that we 've gone home -- we 've been running home so . EOS
SOS and b is our parents at the beginning of us to go to our parents to go to our own brother . EOS
SOS so , in the house alone , in the house alone , the oil height and the tubes , there is no risk . EOS
SOS there 's the blind man then then took me to put in on the edge of the palace , called the palace in the way . EOS
SOS the consequences i still have today to do . EOS
SOS so that 's the big brothers -- they 're not just good for the police but also for the sake of the season . EOS
SOS and our brothers and my brothers , and i 'd really run on top of our way in doing everything out there , which could do , especially , to take a bike ride . EOS
SOS and that 's when we started to have brother started with three years , and then we wanted to -- michael and i wanted to . EOS
SOS and then finally began to drive , as we used to spend a lot of little kids , today , with the speed of the speed , today 's all the way you 're going to do today . EOS
SOS until that could be able to do it . EOS
SOS but we 've just begun that starting with , at some point . EOS
SOS and then the big question : how 's the future of the left ? EOS
SOS and as you get the trust , the one of the parent that the kids are coming back from the street again at a time , and the trust of us , the trust of us , we are not going to drive . EOS
SOS and our solution was that , of course , we 're going to tell a `` our parents , '' where are the celebrities , so where is a car where we 're going to stop a car where , in fact , where there are , of course , there are any other things , EOS houses -- you know , we knew EOS
SOS and we had to look around in the way , but the truth also hear the other on the other . EOS
SOS and you can not test that here in this room , because otherwise , it 's going to be there that you 've never seen anything more about it . EOS
SOS but in addition , if you make it light up , you put it in your bedroom , or you also want to know , as well . EOS
SOS you can try and just keep the same time with your tongue , and you 'll notice that in human beings as well , in humans , people are also equal to us -- they will hear a course . EOS
SOS so , as the bats you 're going to hear , as you can hear , now , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can hear it
SOS and that 's for me in trust , so trust in the movement , always matter . EOS
SOS but in addition to the same amount of money , the security : i have a chance to help myself . EOS
SOS and what i 'm doing with was big difficulty , and it was clear , even without many of the world , one or a half of the world . EOS
SOS now , i do n't know what i 'm seeing today with no more pictures that i 've been very privileged about one of our children as children . EOS
SOS and that 's what happens at the base of our higher buildings . EOS
SOS i 've written with this : the trust is growing through a constant variety . EOS
SOS and that 's what i 've done , because i as a person who is too much later in the workplace , and i 've experienced with people on the scientific page . EOS
SOS i never read it as well . EOS
SOS but i 'm sure to do that , of course , not everybody can experience that . EOS
SOS variety is in the process of our capacity to know where i am , where am i so good , what do i have talent , and where can i really have my capability to participate ? EOS
SOS and our brother just came back , and that 's michael , and i 'd always moved on top of the house . EOS
SOS so then we said , okay , we 're putting a paintbrush here . EOS
SOS there 's a look somewhere out of the same window for example . EOS
SOS and the experimenter then went along with michael , michael , and i 'm probably going to go back to the girl before that girl : `` silent , '' i do n't know . EOS
SOS but finally , who left to be down ? EOS
SOS so i did n't . EOS
SOS and i believe the other way we are the generation of young women here , not yet . EOS . EOS
SOS and from that point , i 'm always going to do that . EOS
SOS and then the result was that we were going to climb all of them three to the next year , and the head to stop at mit , and we did n't even know what to say . EOS
SOS because , of course , trust the path , if other people agree . EOS
SOS so if the dad had said , in order to god , help help , then the danger would be relatively large , that one of us would be afraid of that one of us would be afraid of , and if you were going to EOS
SOS but never happened . EOS
SOS he had to always turn up to it so that he just started to have started to have started to have stage or other words who have taken us out . EOS
SOS and that 's what i thought to me was that we had these opportunities . EOS
SOS but sure , not worry , that 's not a coincidence , no way to put it later . EOS
SOS to me , the different vessels that were always important in my life , all of , interesting . EOS
SOS and most of all , they were all because i could also see them , because i could also see where i am so , where i was going to do so , which may be so my misery . EOS
SOS so i would never have ever been able to get good . EOS . EOS
SOS that 's why i 've never had the telephone . EOS
SOS and i 'm going to go on to you today . EOS
SOS i go to you . i 'm going to get out of rain now . EOS
SOS now , not at five degrees of the moment . EOS
SOS and as you get around the day -- but even better than inside . EOS
SOS but i 've always been able to find myself that i 've discovered that i was so trust that i was going to throw different kinds of tricks . EOS
SOS first of all , for example . EOS
SOS and that was beautiful for me , because that 's the guy who had been told us , ok , we 've never met but kids but send us a few blind children . EOS
SOS in fact , it 's okay , because there are one in you at least very carefully at the horizon . EOS . EOS
SOS and then you realize something else . EOS
SOS and there was always my big trust , because of course , if i want to go through a long time , if i want to go through the future of a long time , because then the other one may do n't know what i do n't do . EOS
SOS so there 's only one way : and that 's that trust in my way . EOS
SOS the other place a foot into the back , and i would fall in love with the air 's head , and then it 's back in the back , and the computer industry is over , because there 's all about the full EOS . EOS
SOS i 'm not going to test it here . EOS
SOS i 'd been thinking about it . EOS . EOS
SOS i mean , this is probably a little bit out of time . EOS
SOS and that 's not why i have no volunteers here , right ? EOS
SOS chimborazo . EOS
SOS nk , i 've gone . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS the next thing to me was as a peace in the school , then it would be used to the side of the tree , EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS my parents were home or me , and they 've been taught us as children . EOS
SOS but to me , i was always interested in school : how can i move too much to school in order to get rid of my total energy ? EOS
SOS and then i had a chance to do that in school . EOS
SOS and even though i was thinking about this , it 's all that 's sort of like , you know , you know , like that 's why , you know , that 's sort of like a little bit , i 'm going to
SOS i thought i used to early -- i 'm not going to call it anymore . EOS
SOS i then said , well , i 'll go up with it . EOS
SOS and the big variety of this sort of thing here is , you know , again , this is the great variety of the sports , because you need one , you need power , and it 's very smooth to emerge . EOS
SOS do you have a lot of work in your work ? EOS
SOS that 's exactly what it is . EOS
SOS you 're only going to quickly get the full confidence into your own technology . EOS
SOS if you trust that trust in your power -- so the power of the power is that you actually can make the bad weather , the bad weather , as you can bring it into the wind , which is also able to bring you to the amount of EOS
SOS and if you actually have faith in my case , you also have faith in my case . EOS
SOS because as an ecologist , that does n't see anything , i 'm obviously going to use it . EOS
SOS and i 've never seen anything like this happening today -- i have to use the word -- my email -- there 's only one -- i 've made my practice now . EOS
SOS but nothing else we do anyway . EOS
SOS now let me give you a couple of times . EOS
SOS do one , one of them another exercise . EOS
SOS but what i 've always understood is that what i do is the kind of thing that i just want to think about what i want to look at the audience just as it is like , if you do n't see anything , it 's going to make you look , and you 're going to get rid of it . EOS
SOS as you can see , you have two in your hand . EOS
SOS and from that point , i mean , i ca n't free hand anymore , otherwise i could take my name , and you can feel it . EOS
SOS it 's not . EOS
SOS so i need to help myself differently . EOS
SOS i then gave my back to it . EOS
SOS and i explain the voice with the voice . EOS
SOS so the thing has to do is always complete complete . EOS
SOS and it 's important for trust . EOS
SOS it 's the language in communication , so it 's in the 1960s . EOS
SOS and i 'm always going to tell you that when you 're talking about it , which is why you say to me and say , `` on the left to 11 , i know it 's easy to left with the left , so on the bottom of the EOS with EOS . EOS
SOS if he says , on the left there is a little bit left to left , and if he says , on the right . EOS
SOS okay , everybody understood ? EOS
SOS and then the final problem , because then i have to ask again , or he has to correct me , i know , i do n't know . now it 's not true . EOS
SOS and to me , i 'm very big , really , because i 'm going to go ahead of it , and i really need to say that completely to tell me completely . EOS
SOS to tell you a little bit , it 's for me the tools for me to really do it in the same competition . EOS
SOS and i can only do that if i can do it with both arms to me , to stand on a leg , and i have to really get the eyes -- ♫ ha ha , or ca n't they be open , EOS EOS . EOS
SOS and you 've got to go so and have to put it back to the other leg and the same thing , and you can do something like this , but you 've got to stand with it . EOS
SOS also , with high shoes . EOS
SOS yes , and that 's very important to me , because i 'm going to go to you about the guy , so i say , `` because i 've only had a lot of men as i can say , '' you have to say EOS
SOS so that does n't know what he says to me . EOS
SOS so i 'm the one that 's going to open him to communications . EOS
SOS and that 's how it 's in each other . EOS
SOS if anybody do n't know my needs , he ca n't help me , but i 'm just asking , and i must say , well , i do n't need to help you the curve of you . EOS
SOS or i practice i need to you like this , like now , when you look at me , you know how long the mountain is , because if we give up the towel , you know , we must be over . now it must be over . EOS
SOS and we do n't think about it in a book , and that thing just does n't sound . EOS
SOS and that 's where i 've been doing the pilot as it 's called , which is when the pilot says , on line up in line , `` we 've only got two minutes behind us , because we might -- we 're going to have -- again , we needed EOS
SOS and from that point to me , that 's important for me to be in the same way that they 've been able to do the same thing . EOS
SOS i 'm listening to him -- there 's probably some other things that are driving on ? EOS
SOS who 's more here ? EOS
SOS so my best time i was a bit faster , but this was in september , and now in april , may i still never mention as much faster as i am . EOS
SOS and in fact , if you 're going on the right right now . EOS
SOS and to me , as i said , these are the same way that i just saw my ears . EOS
SOS and the other thing that i was looking at is exactly what he sees , and i 've got a chance to make my risks in perfect . EOS
SOS and that 's for me one of the important things i say , trust is more training , not this one . EOS
SOS now , not so blind it was n't that much , frankly , by the way . EOS
SOS because i 've also had the experience of my life on the left and left on the left . EOS
SOS and then that was bad at all , because it 's going to go next to three feet . EOS
SOS and i 'm the three feet of the same . EOS
SOS from that point -- as i said , it was -- of course . EOS
SOS i know that , because the helium goes there , we need to turn around . EOS
SOS and what i 'm going to do is to tell you that people say , `` on the left and then say , `` oops , the other left . EOS
SOS so then on the right , unfortunately . EOS
SOS do n't often spend that much . '' EOS often . EOS
SOS but it 's clear , with pressure of pressure , which is probably all of the work of work or whatever it 's going to go . EOS
SOS and then , of course , often , very often , very sudden , very powerful challenge . EOS
SOS but to me , i said , you know , `` you know , i want to know the risks . EOS
SOS and i 've got to say , as someone who ca n't see , i ca n't see the big one , because i do n't give my risks in many ways . EOS
SOS so , you know , i 'm pretty sure that 's all right now . EOS
SOS from driving , tree , from the fall down , i know that i know , and i 'm talking , but of course -- and that 's the important thing -- i 'm going to say the good pages . EOS
SOS and that can also be done when the trust is just there . EOS
SOS and if you find somebody who actually did a hundred percent of the way i need it . EOS
SOS and with that , i 've also had the same goals . EOS
SOS because that 's what i believe in my mind is really important . EOS
SOS you need the same goal , and i really need to realize what does it mean , because really , trust ? EOS ? EOS
SOS because it 's often used as much term you used . EOS
SOS i have faith or myself . EOS
SOS but that 's very important to know that it is too much . EOS
SOS that you give it a lot to you . EOS
SOS and that , you know , because we put people all over the census , we want to see what they want to see . EOS
SOS and the sense that 's quite often often is that we 're also able to achieve the ethical target . EOS
SOS we can do it -- in my case , for example -- from a couple of years ago , i went to the balcony . EOS
SOS and that 's where i 'm going to say . i 've got to look at someone else , or the one that i can trust in the case , that i would also have that mountain up . EOS
SOS and then how do you do that one in the mountain is where you 're going to see in the mountain ? EOS
SOS well , i had , of course , had the huge advantage , and i did n't even know if it comes to me about 100 feet . EOS
SOS and then i had it relatively embarrassing . EOS
SOS if you can be , there can be an advantage of course , not a problem . EOS
SOS and i 've always been working on the fear of science , which is why i 'm going to go down and i 've been doing something like this , because it 's in berlin , in berlin , you 're going to be able to EOS
SOS now , that 's sort of a lot of time , when you hear about it up there , and down the car , you do n't have to see a lot to know about this , now it does n't hurt when i go . EOS
SOS and these things are always interesting to me . EOS
SOS now , in order to also do that , and in order to know , `` hey , i want to leave war '' -- i 'm so focused on that , and i can have a whole new new experience . EOS
SOS and the same thing is exactly the same thing as a result , because there 's been a little bit like this : you go for every 10 hours , and it 's just that one particular time . EOS
SOS you go and just stones around , fewer plants . EOS
SOS you take them on the verge of the jungle , you 're going to have video of world 's first world ago . EOS
SOS so if you can see , it 's the equivalent of the last roughly the last one . EOS
SOS and then the only thing about that . EOS
SOS we 've only seen the cameras from the distance or the other . EOS
SOS i mean , from the process , i got a lot of faith in the hallway -- despite his funny jaw he had that . EOS
SOS because i thought to myself , well , i said , `` well , as i said , i 'll probably walk up faster than that thing . EOS . EOS
SOS but as i said , it 's otherwise pretty much off the other way , because you do n't actually have the right so much . EOS
SOS and what 's really exciting is then if it 's going to be difficult . EOS
SOS so if you go into the ice air and the air stops . EOS
SOS or if it comes next to that , when you put it up , you know , when you put them up and left on the right . EOS
SOS then it 's particularly beautiful , and if it comes to night , and all of the sudden , you know , you have all with your wire , and then we 've already told us that sometimes , now , he would have to take me on the wire so he really EOS me . EOS
SOS because i had as a single person , because it was still a little bit too obvious . EOS
SOS trust what we 've done is i just said , well , i can , of course , my girlfriend , who was about to do a hundred percent trust , i cut them , and we EOS that EOS
SOS but i also have practice i practice , even though i do n't want to focus on it because it is : can you imagine if you 're standing on the mountain on the mountain on the right on one left at 11 . EOS
SOS there 's going to be a few times , and that 's all . EOS
SOS so for us , we have faith in the case we 're looking forward , so we 're putting a string up to you in the hand , and that 's when i had the hand , and then it would be behind her hard EOS . EOS
SOS in other words , the other way i 've been able to do with the level of the page . EOS
SOS and she 's only sitting along with the foot of the foot , '' or she 'd seen it with her , because i 've had a lot of things that i 've never known before , and i would n't have to focus on that . EOS
SOS and what i 've really been showing you about this is how beautiful it is , if you come to , then at some point , there 's a peak that you actually have a goal in the wind EOS , just as well as EOS as the EOS , with EOS EOS . EOS
SOS but on the other hand , however i 've discovered , that i trust that i am in love with me , that there are only only one out there , if i really had the last goal . EOS
SOS it 's also in other ways , as trust as trust . EOS
SOS when we first went to the mountain at night , we were in the group of the first time , and we were going to go back to the other seven people , and the ones were always relatively close to us , and it was always relatively close to us , and it was someone else behind us , EOS
SOS you can not see the girls from the back . EOS
SOS that 's not the reason it seems . EOS
SOS and then finally , i found it , ah , ok , that trust in their skills are also quite helpful . EOS
SOS you go down by night by the dark , and you go about 12 o'clock , you did n't have any light . EOS . EOS
SOS it 's totally appropriate if you 're in charge air , the air is thin , so it 's actually just not yet , yet you 're not going to have yet yet , and now you 're not going to have even
SOS and then at some point , at some point , the moment they said , `` yes , this was actually completely deep to go , because the friend of mine gave me all of this ; we keep constantly going to do it -- just like the women EOS
SOS the whole night we 've been talking about something , and the other people in the group had just been able to know so much that we know , ok , it 's only just a mere hour that i told you . EOS
SOS or i did n't even tell her anything about the mountain . EOS
SOS and that 's exactly what you know , there 's another one in there , which is that there might be a lot of times bad about this , we may have talked to -- it 's only half an hour of the sun . EOS
SOS so these things , that also , can only come from the outside , can only increase the fact that you can also do that , you know , that you can also do that , because you can also do that . EOS
SOS and to me , i 'm sure , and if i 've given it , and i 'm sure , if you just look at that personal , and that 's what really wants to achieve , and in some sense , is right there . EOS
SOS now , that 's obvious , of course , in sports with the gold , where you do n't know , i do n't know why it might make -- you know , i do n't know how to test the value , or see if it 's just a EOS
SOS so i 've found that there is so much at some time that it is , in fact , six hundred times . EOS
SOS if that would be real gold , then i 'm not here , i would be in the craft , i guess . EOS
SOS or at least in sports , we 're running around . EOS
SOS but as i said , i think it 's the real thing , why you do that , you can imagine : what i 've done is actually made my skills and forces at a point . EOS
SOS as i said , i work with my skills , but of course , in the team that we all need , no matter whether , in school , in whatever . EOS
SOS anyway , if old man or young woman , we need people to trust . EOS
SOS and if we had that goal in your mind in mind , and that has been , then the best evidence is that we can keep in a project in our lives . EOS
SOS and if you can , you can also fall in other areas . EOS
SOS thank you very much . EOS
SOS a science for me , that 's the title of my talk , which is designed to make a beautiful map of view . EOS
SOS so what i 'm going to do is to get rid of all the way down the air back as something that is happening in the general population . EOS
SOS in fact , i could be satisfied . EOS
SOS if i look into a reed , there 's all about literature with the literature of scientific issues which is driving . EOS
SOS even each other , of course , a whole range of life took newspapers , full , words , where science issues , are going to be sort of the way they 're going to be . EOS
SOS each of them are at least a little bit where some science is going on . EOS
SOS even that 's completely frustrating when you look at what it 's like , and with scientific issues . EOS
SOS every program has sort of a separate robe in the courtyard , but nevertheless , it 's such a story of a story story . EOS
SOS science is one of the things i 'd like to look at , i 'd like to read it , but i do n't think that . EOS
SOS cool , cool is science just sort of , in terms of bad , anywhere , where are the kind of primitive cool ? EOS ? EOS
SOS in fact such a five minutes ago , there 's nothing to do with reality , but that 's cool , right ? EOS
SOS there i can identify . EOS
SOS big bang , because i can get a lot of it because i do n't understand the jokes , but it 's great . EOS
SOS that 's extremely bad . EOS
SOS because it 's kind of a little paradox that the future will be able to deal with these sorts of problems and things . EOS
SOS but at the same time , it did n't look for yourself . EOS
SOS i have a couple of little examples , like science , or science has just gotten us like that . EOS
SOS a typical example , an example of london , which is a nice designed , the architect , the architect , not so right , so we 're going to build that sort of thing like this . EOS
SOS what 's happening now is now that the sunlight of the top is in this little bit , i 've seen that , and then then somewhere else in the other side of a dot . EOS . EOS
SOS that was big about the press , and there was only a glamour there . EOS
SOS so , as a matter of heat heat , so this poor , which is really long for a long time , there are over the tubes . EOS
SOS because there you are , as an architect , that 's not even a little bit about what you learn in physics , because i mean , i mean , i mean , there 's a mirror stuff . EOS
SOS so , what i 've found is , in fact , is going to be kind of , sort of sketch of letters , where he comes out with radiation , he 's supposed to have a dictator . EOS
SOS so i really wonder , what 's more design or architect or where did it go ? EOS
SOS now that 's a pretty example of an example . EOS
SOS one of the things that we 've got to do with these kinds of information is also the connections . EOS
SOS now , pollen is now a few years ago when that just sort of happened to the media . EOS
SOS that 's where the train had been completed , because it had plants that was once a danger . EOS
SOS genes were filled with green selection . EOS
SOS genes were kind of the same thing . EOS
SOS boy , oh , there are genes in there . EOS
SOS there were situations where people really would have gotten on the market , so hey , i have had a vegetable vegetable . EOS
SOS no idea what that is . yes . EOS
SOS so , yes , okay , we 'll discuss about it . EOS
SOS but at the time , i was in the lab where i was in the lab , and i was totally frustrated by trying to have these evil genes in my bacteria . EOS . EOS
SOS and it was totally frustrated , i came home , and my favorite neighbors , you know , you look not happy , so what 's going on ? EOS
SOS i said , yes , i 'm going to try and get a little bit of my own into my bacteria , and it does n't work at all . EOS
SOS that was what i 've been trying to explain , to explain , which is kind of , genes , i thought , yes , if i talk about genes , you know what it means . EOS
SOS that was what i was really meant to , which was a particular sequence that i wanted to bring into this session . EOS
SOS but that was what the woman saw . EOS
SOS this woman never went back to my hand ! EOS
SOS who knows what i was wearing you ? EOS ? EOS
SOS genes are very bad . EOS
SOS now that 's good for a second time , and yet this is sort of conscious in consciousness . EOS
SOS genes , that 's what happens . EOS
SOS now , i 've been quite read quite a lot of time . EOS
SOS it 's always taken in the technology , and it really has been embedded in our language . EOS
SOS it 's going to be in europe , a headline . EOS
SOS there 's plenty of other corn that actually does n't have any genes . EOS
SOS another cloud , eating food rats die . EOS
SOS yes , that was a pretty nice story . EOS
SOS but they are n't too old , and it 's not quite a matter of fact ; it does n't matter which people i feel more comfortable . EOS
SOS in fact , whether it 's time or the picture , all talking about food . EOS
SOS luckily , there 's still not been running yet out there , but i 'm afraid it does n't take a long time . EOS
SOS but it just shows , which is about uncertainty in the population , because they just do n't work with the things . EOS
SOS we need to work in our future with these technologies . EOS
SOS now the big thing was , none of the big thing i was going to talk about , but it 'll be quite clear , and i think most of you who have no real idea . EOS
SOS and that 's pretty sad . EOS
SOS how does all this information from the lab in the lab ? EOS
SOS if we assume this little boy , young , researchers sitting in his lab , we have an experiment , something beautiful and good , and it falls , you know , that 's the public . EOS
SOS then the first one has to go to the professor . EOS
SOS the head , the driver , the driver , okay , is called his name on it , which is always important in science . EOS
SOS good idea , i 'm still not in the public ; it 's about a drug . EOS
SOS yes , the head thinks , oh , great idea , great , because we 're going to make a challenge here . EOS
SOS so , by the way , we 've got a press with a project , a lovely idea , and that comes out out of the air . EOS
SOS that 's going to get off , yes , but actually who ? EOS
SOS now this is as rare as we usually have multiple copies of a shared , a common line . EOS
SOS and from all of these are going to get the squares , the really cool projects , then we 're going to talk about the reports of the magazine , to find whether it 's deadly , whether it 's climate , whether it 's legal , whether it 's deadly , whether you care , whether it 's deadly , it 's
SOS that 's the path . EOS
SOS from the ground , it 's going to fall down and forth up , and really really cool , really cool , really cool , really , really cool , really cool projects out there . EOS
SOS these are great marketing marketing , which are really good , are there of all of everyone 's for free , yes , but who are i left with it ? EOS
SOS in fact , only those who are interested in this . EOS
SOS in the meantime , we 're going to call that to the end of the day . EOS
SOS so the ones who are already interested in is that then the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good . EOS
SOS beautiful magazine , in the audience , the audience who are interested in care about this , and maybe they might have an idea where it goes into those papers . EOS
SOS now , who cares ? i mean ? EOS
SOS the amount of the things that people who were interested in it . EOS
SOS it was now , which was now , in fact , in the philippines , and i call it mr. hours , who was trying to do it under which other people reading it , i try to hold it out , i 'm not really sure . EOS
SOS yet , again , our future will only be able to , as we think about this . EOS
SOS energy , energy , renewable energy , the race , these are all kinds of things that mr. does n't really understand , and it 's kind of like it . EOS
SOS my project , my idea is so different , these little , young , to take scientists out of the ice system , really completely from a regular point of life , and give him a course of how to communicate science . EOS
SOS so what happens is that a scientist is the scientist , so i 've been a guy , we 've been known for the rest of 20 years , it 's a saturday rule not to ask him . EOS
SOS as soon as he went down his mouth and talking about his business , he left us . EOS
SOS boy , these are scientists who tell me about what 's going on . EOS
SOS in fact , it sounds counterintuitive , spinning , technically is almost the same level as genes . EOS
SOS machine being treated , which is sort of , oh , you do n't know what 's behind . EOS
SOS i really want to look at it , look at that , that 's beautiful and good , if you 're at a conference , and where you 're standing at a conference and you 're going to tell people to talk about your kids , and you 'd like to talk about them , but let 's still give you a little bit about EOS
SOS where is the problem it really is to use and ordinary ? EOS
SOS so i school , that 's my idea , these young , young scientists , who are not so far in the hierarchy of the hierarchy , which are still a little bit , and the school i thought about as you go . EOS
SOS this has been all of the use for everyone to use , investors , who also want to know what 's going on . EOS . EOS
SOS and finally , that 's the money that used to be used as well , so those who also have to communicate with each other . EOS
SOS but this training , that 's just a story . EOS
SOS and i really want you to get them to a mast , and i want to introduce you your project , you know , i 'm happy to say , `` oh , dear , honest . it 's not . EOS
SOS there 's a quote , i do n't know if it 's real , because you ca n't just explain it , you really do n't really understand it . EOS
SOS so , the scientists from the lab to take it really , how can i possibly communicate this ? EOS
SOS there 's a lot of stories there . EOS
SOS in fact , all of them are totally modern , it 's everywhere , in every university , but in fact , there 's only one point that i basically was in the process . EOS
SOS so , who 's going to get to the end of the city at some point of time , are now going to get a speech to a lecture ? EOS
SOS these are the people who are doing it . EOS
SOS this is where i started again again . EOS
SOS so these are the people who are interested in this right now and watch each other talks . EOS
SOS it 's beautiful , because there are any kind of being done , all of each being happy , everyone 's happy , go home , and that 's it . EOS
SOS so i 'm going to give you a second point to say that it 's not about to work with that project . EOS
SOS and these scientists are also more educated , how do we really do children ? EOS
SOS because there 's a lot of really principles to reduce that . EOS
SOS because scientists , how do they work and how children their world , they are identical . EOS
SOS children are very extremely scientific science . EOS
SOS they 're doing something like that . EOS
SOS they try , does it work ? EOS
SOS flying food , fall off , no way , works , let 's change some , i change a couple of slides , make it even new . EOS
SOS children learn extremely scientifically . EOS
SOS these are really lonely , and i left them , i look at what happens , which is what i need to change , it works or not . EOS
SOS that 's normal . EOS
SOS but that 's a lot of scenarios . EOS
SOS and from that point , i think , really , can only work that if you come out of the neighborhood , and these scientists , as a scientist , in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids , out of kindergarten , with school , where kids are actually doing the same language . EOS
SOS and then you might be , perhaps , that 's such my hope that kids will have it home , and then i 'm going to get rid of the fellow , which is also used for some scientific issues , because the children telling him that . EOS
SOS that 's not somewhere in the newspaper , this is not dead at tedwomen , but his kids tell him something that has been working on it , and his children tell him something that has been working on a food , but that it has a bread , and then also , as an architect , maybe the head EOS
SOS and not only get to get rid of this guy , but also the owner . EOS
SOS that 's my idea , my vision , my project . EOS
SOS unfortunately , that 's what it 's about to do is that the first couple of work i call , i said , yes , we 've got , you know , to our scientists , that 's just not about these scientists , this is just not a subject EOS . EOS
SOS a scientist must not communicate . EOS
SOS yes , i think , okay , i 'll call the next one . EOS
SOS but if you work in a state , it 's a company in a company , as well as well , there are always the next one . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS i 'm crazy , the question . EOS
SOS you ca n't fly every day . EOS
SOS the last weeks was terrible . EOS
SOS the weather has a big deal with the calculation . EOS
SOS seven , five years ago i 'd been asked whether i 'd like to take that . EOS
SOS i was at age , almost 10 years ago , at the end of alabama and in alabama . EOS
SOS we 've come up pretty far up . EOS
SOS they had a client as customer . EOS
SOS and to me it was actually more , you know , that 's why . EOS
SOS so what is this going to do ? EOS
SOS so it 's actually ridiculous . EOS
SOS but i 've learned to you , but i know who 's behind it , and that 's what i 'm here today . EOS
SOS and maybe it 's a little bit crazy , but it 's also very emotional . EOS
SOS it 's beautiful and it 's always big fun . EOS
SOS and i 'm going to show you in the next three and a half minutes a little bit out of that life . EOS minutes . EOS
SOS i 'm a journalist in the van . EOS
SOS the company has been around a hundred years . EOS
SOS i 'm a member of the turtle . EOS
SOS this company has been around for 20 years . EOS
SOS and the ceo of the u.n . EOS
SOS the company has been around for about 7,000 or years . EOS
SOS this is going to run the sequel here on the back . EOS
SOS bess . EOS
SOS and that 's a picture i want to show you the little dot , which is a little bit right that is actually as a red person on it , or something , does n't know , is that the point is too big . EOS
SOS there 's only about 10,000 times now . EOS
SOS and it 's actually just 10 active active today . EOS
SOS that 's what happens . EOS
SOS there are about 20 thousand pairs of global revenue . EOS . EOS
SOS so that 's actually not a market . EOS
SOS that 's not even a curiosity . EOS
SOS this is a beefalo , a servant . EOS
SOS and the question is , why do you do that ? EOS
SOS how does this all happen ? EOS
SOS in fact , in the prison sector and only 10 , we can still talk about why that is . EOS
SOS very close to history . EOS
SOS in fact , a lot of his head that came home here . EOS
SOS in short ways . EOS
SOS it has gone up to the first world war in 2010 . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS then in the first war war , the palace of the day of the day of the day of the time of war , were used by the first war war , and the world war
SOS so then they started london , and so on and so forth . EOS
SOS and when we walked around and eight to london , and with a large round of flying there a flying campaign to fly , the english spoke of papers with the title : this time , they come , but not with bombs , but EOS . EOS
SOS so the story has been in there . EOS
SOS and we had a performance campaign . EOS
SOS but , in fact , the customer was n't so much , because all of his sudden suddenly realized what was going on there , which had broken old memories inside . EOS
SOS and you know , it was a little bit more interesting . EOS
SOS but nevertheless , it was a good place in london , but the weather was very bad and very shocking . EOS
SOS and we did n't have a huge farm . EOS
SOS then , in the end of the 20th century , followed of congress , has taken over . EOS
SOS and one of the things that went to america . EOS
SOS this has a story that the whole german nation had sort of felt felt about as a result , and as a result of that was taken away . EOS
SOS there it was then in new york records with new york . EOS
SOS and the whole german nation has been cut up , we 're back to . EOS
SOS this is all in the middle of this room , and this is really a little bit of the myth of this device . EOS
SOS but in fact , then the way up to five and only five , six , seven , seven , has built in the first place , and actually only two really really big ones , which are the kidney vessels , and the EOS
SOS in fact , a hundred of people , where there were burning around the end of it , it was at the end of the end . EOS
SOS but it was a myth . EOS
SOS and then the premise at that time was the first time that 's crash , which is , unfortunately , also . EOS
SOS next to the titanic , the event at the time , where one of an icon , a product , and then never left it . EOS . EOS
SOS and then the other devices have been accepted . EOS
SOS and in addition to the past , the last hadron collider destroyed . EOS
SOS it uses the materials that uses the materials for the sun , as the materials uses for the trains , as the materials uses
SOS then it was n't about 7,000 years ago . EOS
SOS and then those of the sudden that we were doing , and the fears that had the idea , maybe you should start to do that again . EOS
SOS and i got hooked because you 've got a great product of product , you 'd be there , but the market . EOS
SOS yes , he 's got a market ? EOS
SOS so what 's going on ? EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS that 's what we 're talking about now . EOS
SOS it 's going to escape that this is perhaps just about to explain , but we 're still going to take it back in time . EOS
SOS there are a lot of companies who are designed out of this study . EOS
SOS it 's today today , about 20 billion miles . EOS
SOS this is a real economy , high school . EOS
SOS there 's a lot of it . EOS
SOS and they also made me feel here . EOS
SOS it 's actually a very normal plane like any other plane , but it has , sorry , a gas has a gas , a gas hot , not hydrogen , and also having a breath along . EOS
SOS it 's like a water that 's in water and under it , and it needs to be doing that . EOS
SOS the time is n't there in detail . EOS
SOS in the inside it looks like this , with a structure . EOS
SOS there are two types of pairs of verbs . EOS
SOS there are guides , which is , in case , in the case . EOS . EOS
SOS they have no structure in the area , and they 're sort of like a street tree . EOS
SOS these are the most stages that we built in the world , about four , five piece . EOS
SOS and that 's only today , as i said earlier , only before that was in the middle of our own , so only 20 . EOS
SOS so this is what the production looks like when it comes up with a device . EOS
SOS the second on the left . EOS
SOS and the connection is also working . EOS
SOS comes out of the heel . EOS
SOS hc : the clitoris of the infection . EOS
SOS back then there are the roots . EOS
SOS costs two million dollars of that . EOS . EOS
SOS and if you have to be careful , you have to be compassionate and you have to be compassionate , because you have to look at the moment that if you had a knee in it or a hole that it ca n't keep up . EOS
SOS so this is where the kids used to make more and look at whether it 's going to flow into holes . EOS
SOS and at the end of the end , there 's a video of water as it is there . EOS
SOS so the technician is designed to create a product product . EOS
SOS and you can see that here on the numbers very quickly . EOS
SOS one point of nine percent , which is nine percent , one , six four percent , which is about a thousand thousand miles in the year , or maybe it might die . EOS
SOS it 's very , very very little . EOS
SOS that 's a plate . EOS
SOS you can see it . EOS
SOS but there 's a different trend that is going to be right now , and that 's where i 've been up here . EOS
SOS we had started three percent of years ago when i started from five five years ago , eight years ago , 40 percent of the year , and last year , or last year , EOS percent or EOS . EOS
SOS and this year in may , we were at 3.3 percent . EOS
SOS if you want to get the eight years , my eight years , you can talk about the eight years , and then you can tell that in those eight years of course , of course , an extension of the body , too clear , in those eight years , the weather EOS
SOS we 're superstar . EOS
SOS we ca n't fly through sugar . EOS
SOS they want to see something . EOS
SOS and you can get the brakes or the speed of the sun in a year . EOS
SOS so a small video of the fact that our weather did n't only matter , but also , because we do weather weather every day . EOS
SOS but because that 's like that , that 's the good thing to do a program , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an incredibly part of this program . EOS
SOS i come from finland today . EOS
SOS the health model is here , it 's a flying lab . EOS
SOS the campaign is called the campaign . EOS
SOS and we 're going to zoom in the base between the ice tree , between the sun . EOS
SOS it 's called pre-death . EOS
SOS and the head t goes from italy to baseball to finland in a row . EOS . EOS
SOS over many of a lot of a hundred times , one of a lot of hundred times , one of the air , how they react to the things we respond to the ground . EOS
SOS so , here 's how i 'm just going to talk about this , and this is where we are about the second of the second . EOS
SOS a great man . EOS
SOS and if you want to look like this , you want to look out of the subject of weather . EOS
SOS so that 's very well . EOS
SOS and here are a couple of scenarios there . EOS
SOS that 's what i 'd like about sweden last week or two week . EOS
SOS and in finland , in pennsylvania , the weather is great , the drama , five degrees , 30 degrees . EOS
SOS they say that something never happened . EOS
SOS i 've just had wonderful wonderful , beautiful great days . EOS . EOS
SOS and of course , they were n't so bad at all . EOS
SOS we were also in africa . EOS
SOS and if you look for king , when you were looking for king , they would have been looking for , and they were looking at , and they are the ones that are programmed by over million years . EOS
SOS but you can also ask yourself , that 's all africa , and then if you ask what you 're asking for some idea , when you ask an idea , you ask , it makes sense if you ask in the movie world , or EOS EOS
SOS so i asked myself , well , what are we going to do ? EOS
SOS and so what do we do ? EOS ? EOS
SOS in the end , we went back to two years . EOS
SOS it was n't going to go further . EOS
SOS the whole thing came back then , and the project was finished . EOS
SOS and one of the bear who wrote the bank bank at the very first place that he could also stay anywhere down . EOS
SOS but it was n't so bad . EOS
SOS we had a very good fortune there , and we were really happy . EOS
SOS that was the prototype . EOS
SOS and i did n't know what to do with that . EOS
SOS yes , what we 're going to do today is a very short sample of this one . EOS
SOS what we 're going to do today is this about complexity , it 's about complexity , it 's about question , growth . EOS
SOS what we 're doing today is that we 're doing here today . EOS
SOS we 're going to get rid of course . EOS
SOS we have to keep the contract . EOS . EOS
SOS it 's called genomics . EOS . EOS
SOS there are always devices in there , for example , and it 's going to be replaced again . EOS
SOS we 're using the entire budget for almost five million dollars . EOS
SOS we 're talking to the clients . EOS . EOS
SOS we 're going to keep doing the things all the time . EOS
SOS we are a national system that 's designed by the germans and by the european union , and all the time , or whatever , or whatever . EOS
SOS and that 's also too , and it has money and still has to get money and still have money . EOS
SOS the question is : do you really go ? EOS
SOS do you want to develop more ? EOS
SOS do you make bigger audio ? EOS
SOS there are guides , pure acid . EOS
SOS so what do you do ? EOS
SOS are you going into the market ? EOS
SOS are you going to keep on ? EOS
SOS and that 's what we 're naturally trying to do in time . EOS
SOS and there we also have a couple of scenarios . EOS
SOS and as by the way , the senate went through a lot of the tubes and went away . EOS
SOS at the beginning of the day at the beginning , there was still a sales of death . EOS
SOS the population of the german population was saved by six million hours as a kidney , when the fourth of the labor was taken , and he was basically amazed by the population . EOS
SOS and that 's at the time , and the other companies , we were able to figure out , or not even here today , and there would be other companies as well . EOS
SOS we were in tokyo , idaho . EOS
SOS we were , and they 're listening in san francisco with a client . EOS
SOS behind that there was a very influential male . EOS
SOS both projects are unfortunately . EOS
SOS so they 're also running . EOS
SOS at the same time , we 've won . EOS
SOS i have n't got a picture here because we can not show that . EOS
SOS but in america , today 's now today is going to be on the verge of the first sabbatical . EOS
SOS we 've sold three units . EOS
SOS in addition to each other , we create a partner in the technology . EOS
SOS and that 's a big success , but at the same time , there 's a big success . EOS
SOS two customers are basically being caught because it did n't . EOS
SOS why was n't it ? EOS
SOS we actually know that . EOS
SOS either , the location was not the right or the police , or in america , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
SOS and the people who have seen as well as seen this , they said , `` oh , once again , again , a crocodile , the power makes advertising . EOS
SOS because there 's no idea that you can get there . EOS
SOS and it was actually to make me twice in marketing to make it over , `` hey , guys call it . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS the burning on the year , in the year , etc. , awkward pipes , they died . EOS
SOS but last year , we 've only done that in the weather . EOS
SOS there 's a half million times about half a million . EOS
SOS that 's bad . EOS
SOS the zeppelin here is the ross ridge here . EOS
SOS it 's the sense of , of course , if i look at the age of the hills , and everyone is laughing , and we do n't have to make advertising as well because it is going to go to my friends , the family . EOS EOS
SOS and we 're brilliant . EOS
SOS i 've always got to wind up with the mistake that you are thinking of , you know . EOS . EOS
SOS you could still do it again . EOS
SOS so we 've got a bow at the grocery store , and we 're overdue . EOS
SOS that 's not quite true . EOS
SOS we are also doing advertising . EOS
SOS this has been an art project , which has been accepted . EOS
SOS and i was doing this on the island of the island . EOS
SOS but the coordination is a harder market . EOS
SOS and you also have to ask yourself , makes sense always sense ? EOS
SOS we 've got a lot of time , but internet has a lot of changes in the beginning of the launch , because they control everything control . EOS
SOS the slope of that is largely smooth , so today we 're going to be here today . EOS
SOS we have three here . EOS
SOS two active , one of these things , the sales , three , bought , 10 are active . EOS
SOS so then six of 10 . EOS
SOS that 's what we 're going to get to the market if it 's at all . EOS
SOS and hope that it can also come back to a future . EOS
SOS and what happened at the end of david scott , the apollo nobel prize , looking back at his desk paris , and five , he said , `` as a walk on the game hand , the apollo page shows what i call . EOS
SOS so fishing is beautiful . EOS
SOS for example , we 're too beautiful . EOS
SOS we do n't find customers . EOS
SOS we 're going to find that way we think it has a technological value . EOS
SOS there we have customers . EOS
SOS that 's not rocket . EOS
SOS it 's delicious , it 's going on . EOS
SOS that 's how a market takes years to get it . EOS
SOS and then there is no one . EOS
SOS there is also a strange effect which can be easy and hard to control . EOS
SOS in any case , that 's the point , the situation , the point in the economy , so it 's not a market . EOS
SOS and yet we go . EOS
SOS it 's an icon of the region . EOS
SOS the patrollers have the power to make it . EOS
SOS they only ask the question : what are we going to do ? EOS
SOS how much money do we put in the global world ? EOS
SOS what do we do for this ? EOS
SOS in which , what 's going on ? EOS ? EOS
SOS and i personally , you also have asked me to say something to say , i 'm sure to tell you something , which is , of course , to speak to the end of my talk , where to where i wanted to get to it back at the back of the back of the time , then it 's about EOS . EOS
SOS i 've also been working at the 1930s three years , when i was born through eastern island , and this whole record , i 've seen this so that i made it . EOS . EOS
SOS and then there was a sequence about that , which is that there 's money , not knowing what to do with that , and almost did it . EOS
SOS so they brought me to put that out . EOS
SOS and i 've taken three years away as i 've been saying this in hope for a long future . EOS . EOS
SOS zero , that 's true ? go ahead seconds , i 'm still ready , thank you . EOS
SOS morton bast EOS
SOS yeah , thank you very much . EOS
SOS these are my three points that i want to talk about in the 1960s . EOS
SOS why are we in the face of the economy or the abundance ? EOS
SOS how are we going to finance ? EOS
SOS and most importantly , what do you do ? EOS
SOS what 's actually going on ? EOS
SOS let 's start with our first point . EOS
SOS the first part is perhaps a little bit . EOS
SOS but also it 's also to show the challenges . EOS
SOS a couple of years ago that even harder happened to explain that . EOS
SOS we have a problem today , a child . EOS
SOS we have problems . EOS
SOS but it 's worth that again , again , these are the challenges for example . EOS
SOS all sorts of things are exponential . EOS
SOS if you look at it in a historical long way , the risk for example , then that 's going to be a very quick slide in history . EOS
SOS at the moment , we ca n't imagine that it is a little bit different than that oil is going down and further up . EOS
SOS you know the climate change , which has been past years . EOS
SOS some people say , well , in the past , we used to do it again , let 's look at the last 10 years . EOS
SOS you can also look at it as though , i 'm also right now . EOS
SOS you can also tell , who does it take ? EOS
SOS you can also say , the ocean is far away . EOS
SOS but it goes , if you 're a little bit deeper with , you really want to get really real challenges , to avoid things that really really avoid , otherwise we 've just got trouble at the same time in health . EOS
SOS it 's about 30 degrees ago . EOS . EOS
SOS and there 's a degree in our cities as we do in greece , or in other words . EOS
SOS however , it 's also around , mostly in asia . EOS
SOS think about the himalayas , where the large lakes and the edges of those of them from the himalayas comes from the himalayas . EOS
SOS it 's not about the planet . EOS
SOS the planet is what we 're doing , because there was a lot of larger crisis . EOS
SOS and in addition , but it 's about the people who are sort of living into a very deep ecosystems . EOS
SOS it 's about loss of biodiversity . EOS
SOS the charges are spread out . EOS
SOS it 's becoming less and less . EOS
SOS this is the sea sea , where an extension part of our cotton comes from . EOS
SOS and all of this , where does this come from ? EOS
SOS these whole bad things , i 'm telling you , in the one hand or some other form or global warming combined . EOS
SOS with what we harvest from the earth we harvest . EOS
SOS it 's not only that the oil and the oxygen and the tumor , but also the renewables of the cost is that it 's inevitable but it 's close to the same one . EOS
SOS and we just want to see that we 're going to use as much as we used to use it , and then again , less likely to produce less waste and revenue . EOS
SOS so it is about this , which is , in fact , it has already been told to reduce the entire transformation of the entire field . EOS
SOS that 's the challenge , not only climate , not only south of two , just to live from one car in another way . EOS
SOS unlike the economies . EOS . EOS
SOS our engineering completely changed . EOS
SOS now , if we look at a moment , we still look at the time , and there are still on the planet societies that are basically alive with a ton of resources per year . EOS
SOS it was then in the 1960s era of human history three to five tons . EOS
SOS today , it 's five to 2015 . EOS
SOS so they 've got these tools . EOS
SOS and it is very , very smooth distributed around the earth . EOS
SOS it 's in north america , more than more than more than the planet . EOS
SOS and in other parts of the world , look at africa , look at africa , much less . EOS
SOS and it comes to us , we can give the effects of the implications of us , the rivers , the air has much better better than the last decades , but it 's basically basically that we have this in other parts of the world . EOS
SOS and the other parts of the world does n't work that much less . EOS
SOS and that 's why the conflicts we 're seeing from , of course , is , afghanistan , wherever you look at the map of the american survey , and then you see where the tools are coming . EOS
SOS and that 's there , especially , which is , there are many resources where there are many resources there , where the people in the world are . EOS
SOS so if we want to beat it up , we need to remember ourselves . EOS
SOS so we have to change the ecological boundaries everywhere , the frequency is everywhere . EOS
SOS and what we 've had here to do is that what we 're going to do here to do is that we have n't been
SOS now , this has been mahatma gandhi when he said , the world has got enough to anyone , but not for anybody . EOS
SOS and there we are , as we think of life , there 's a lot of it here . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS so that was kind of an unintended part . EOS
SOS but i always think that you need a need to understand what to change . EOS
SOS even if i was going to say , it 's worth something like that , unlike other people , which is more susceptible . EOS
SOS but in fact , it 's always a sort of sense of what that means , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
SOS so , what is it ? EOS
SOS and there we have to realize that we share in our societies around the world that we 've seen so much , in the rich parts of the world , we 're often not comfortable with that . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS now here 's a pretty good mood , but there are people , and you 're also familiar with people who are not so well able to deal with this story . EOS
SOS i 've written it up . EOS
SOS and the climate change , climate change have the same cause . EOS
SOS we work too much . EOS . EOS
SOS that 's one of the page we 're in stress , and at some point it 's too much . EOS
SOS i also work like that . EOS
SOS and on the other hand , we 're going to push these tools . EOS
SOS but what is a good life ? EOS
SOS how can we define that ? EOS
SOS now there 's a little scientific result of that . EOS
SOS and also what i 've said before , and what i 'm going to do is , which i 'm going to do is sort of , but here 's this : how can i first define this ? EOS
SOS and there 's important to understand that there are always two aspects of life . EOS
SOS quality has the aspect of an objective of how to eat what i have . EOS
SOS did i have a roof over the head ? EOS
SOS i have friends ? EOS
SOS i mean , can i participate in life ? EOS
SOS but also , how do you deal with it , how do i feel about it ? EOS
SOS i 'm going to push that sometimes the case of life . EOS
SOS and then i 'm doing two words which are important at the point . EOS
SOS that one is needs . EOS
SOS the needs to be the fundamental dimension of our human development , of our view . EOS
SOS if we can have our needs , we are happy . EOS
SOS and you ca n't say it 's needs to be sustainable or not sustainable . EOS
SOS do n't want to run a business problem , it 's not going to use the
SOS what are needs ? EOS
SOS if you can sample a bunch of scientists , i 've only mentioned two . EOS
SOS and you see , of course , the physical needs , but the desire for safety , social relationships . EOS
SOS after protection , after conservation , for example , about creativity , with parkinson , with freedom . EOS
SOS that all has a little bit to do with money . EOS
SOS but at a large part , actually , not at all , but the question is , how can i put it in my life . EOS
SOS and there i am at the second important term . EOS
SOS the strategies . EOS
SOS the strategy that i use to do is to make these needs . EOS
SOS and there it is already on that i can use with a large use of a high use , or a low mechanism . EOS
SOS i can need a lot of money or money . EOS
SOS strategies are just my behavior as i say my needs . EOS
SOS this has to do with my values with the resources , with the opportunities i have . EOS
SOS if i have a little bit of money , i 'll try and see my needs when i had a lot of money on that . EOS
SOS it 's about the end of the day , which is the roof over the head , and then the kind of thing to eat . EOS
SOS and here 's where it comes to a lot or a little bit , that can be a sustainable or permanent . EOS
SOS and if we all the strategies for me to do my needs , then the needs of that , then we talk about a lifestyle . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS that was the sort of scientific effort . EOS
SOS and now , what can we do now ? EOS
SOS how about it ? EOS ? EOS
SOS and there 's just a couple of evidence here . EOS
SOS of course , it must also find anyone for yourself . EOS
SOS but the evidence of the individual species in a technological way , which is , in fact , is that i 've talked about a lot of technology , and also in a political way . EOS
SOS what can we do ? EOS
SOS what can we do ? EOS
SOS what do we do ? EOS
SOS so where do we want to go ? EOS
SOS the slides at the beginning is that i said the danger is that we 're going to use more resources . EOS
SOS and finally , the quality of the quality of life is getting worse because of the effects of getting worse and the effects are getting worse and back to the rest of us . EOS
SOS or , whether we can do it , then there 's a different way of going to go through less dimensions , perhaps less but a higher quality of life . EOS
SOS there 's one of my favorites , maybe some of them might be familiar with him , and so more quality of this topic , so more of the quality of fewer materials . EOS
SOS there 's a lot of technology how can i get any single thing that we 're using the computer , the orange juice , the one hand , the traffic , how can i make that ? EOS
SOS now , i can do a different tool today ; i can build the house out of wood , etc . EOS
SOS in order to create much less or the same quality of life . EOS
SOS i mean , my other teachers , as long as i 've been able to do so forth , which is about flying per barrel , and that 's where we 've been now already now already now , there 's a deep space on it . EOS
SOS where are the needs ? EOS
SOS so , what kind of services can i do ? EOS
SOS and how can i do that by doing this ? EOS
SOS and it 's not a little bit less than your heart rate , more than less percent less . EOS
SOS there are many examples that you can do that . EOS
SOS in denmark , a tower built at a tower . EOS
SOS with seven circles it has been built in it already . EOS
SOS it 's basically made of wood . EOS
SOS you may not have to take it back in time , and then it goes back to the parts , and you do n't want to get much less resources with anything else , with this fifth of the child 's life . EOS
SOS but there 's a lot in our own , so , how do i actually do it ? EOS
SOS a nice book has written a beautiful book . EOS
SOS where he shows how hard it 's going to get away from the inside of this cave . EOS
SOS the patrollers , i want to get myself to come to the other , and then i 'm sort of going to end in that race . EOS
SOS you 've got to know , you know , i 'd sing quickly , and i 'm going to call the new one . EOS
SOS the most beautiful thing i want to do , they all know . EOS
SOS when i started my lab , a few years ago we 've written letters . EOS
SOS and then you 've got to wait until the letter now , until the letter now , i 'll close email with you is fully massive . EOS
SOS that 's what i call hundreds of emails . EOS
SOS and i can do a lot more . EOS
SOS this is productivity , which is economic growth , we 're going to get back to it . EOS
SOS but i did n't really have time . EOS
SOS i did a lot of doing this . EOS
SOS but there 's good examples , slow food , for example , where i really want to look at the probability of the quality and the child 's recovery . EOS . EOS
SOS and with a very , very able to make more quality of life . EOS
SOS one of my favorite examples is that . EOS
SOS now , there 's a bunch of time today today , that in fact , is that in fact , in germany , in germany , about thousands of thousands of things in germany . EOS
SOS you can begin to count it . EOS
SOS who was two , three generations of thousands of thousands of things , had employees , writing . EOS . EOS
SOS they have the power gap . EOS
SOS we have to deal with that . EOS
SOS and there are fewer people coming up with these whole issues . EOS
SOS and you need a clue that helps us with these kinds of things . EOS
SOS now , if you want to think about this , i 'm going to be interesting , and you might be able to take away from the spaceship , because i 'm not , you know , there are no thousands of things . EOS
SOS for example , the next example of this has grown instead . EOS
SOS a true boom . EOS
SOS now , star , five times , maybe it might have been developed for a hundred years ago into the developed industry . EOS
SOS in the meanwhile , people are more and more people think of them as they think . EOS
SOS if you think about it . EOS
SOS meanwhile , working on how to work with the things we 've already been building , and this beautiful sequence here a few hundred years ago that a few hundred years ago , still started to use a couple of years ago , and yet over the other centuries , EOS
SOS what you need was to use better . EOS
SOS that 's a question of justice . EOS
SOS and i 've been showing you before , you know , like this is a picture between africa and europe , and a world world . EOS
SOS so in the same way that all at the same time , with these resources , only then we can use less . EOS
SOS and that does n't mean less quality of life , because many of us have been so much too much . EOS
SOS but it 's an important task of the economy , the company , these products , these services really have to provide a good life at a much less resources . EOS
SOS last thing , which has been something to do with the major politics , and that 's what i call that . EOS
SOS if you read a little bit carefully at the time , then you 're going to see some of pollen 's disease , you know , now that 's what happens every week will bring back to the bottom . EOS
SOS it 's called , yes , a crisis is the door of my view , and also to what we 've been talking about , sort of , really , with behavioral economists , and with people here , here are the numbers for parties , you can just go down to EOS
SOS and there is no reason to have growth , as i know that from my youth , from the 1970s . EOS
SOS for a part of that , there are mathematical reasons . EOS
SOS one point five percent growth is about as much as eight percent years ago . EOS
SOS and the eight percent is that what china has today . EOS
SOS it 's about where we might have years ago . EOS
SOS in fact , if the cake is bigger , it is of course of course it 's still eight percent . EOS
SOS one percent is still a lot , so we 're going to do it well . EOS
SOS but you 've got to put yourself on it , which is , not even if we had zero percent growth , that 's because the next year is exactly so much producing and consume and income in this year . EOS
SOS we can do that well , and we can work with it . EOS
SOS now , that 's why you 've seen these statistics which shows the growth on the growth of the growth of life . EOS
SOS the economy is growing , but the quality of life is about to the state of life that we are . EOS
SOS and by the way , also without the growth , without growth , and it does n't seem to be the same way that all of us and how they 're all going to follow us . EOS
SOS that 's not true , and then you have to look at the economics . EOS
SOS and it comes again and increasingly and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and the next week , or the next week , which is , in the trend , a greater story with this subject ,
SOS in fact , edward sen , who led a nobel prize at his point of time saying that he said the good life is the good economy , the good economy of life , the good life . EOS
SOS that 's not about the end of the past , and not not stop the returns , not to create growth in our countries . EOS
SOS for those countries , for example , for china , for india , there 's a whole other story . EOS
SOS and that 's only going to start under the surface , when we 're still going to grow , and we just sort of on this level of scale at this level of level that we are living on to live and economies . EOS
SOS it also requires politics . EOS
SOS it takes goals . EOS
SOS it takes a lot , tell the economists . EOS
SOS it takes not only possible for the growth , but we should really look and measure and ask , how about the quality of life , right ? EOS
SOS is this one ? EOS
SOS and then our politicians measure our politicians . EOS
SOS now , of course , how much is it ? EOS
SOS how does this all work together ? EOS
SOS we need a fundamental aspect of what we finally ca n't get away , not work . EOS
SOS who you 're particularly familiar with you , but also the gods , you know , well , that 's very well . EOS
SOS so what kind of driving goes from now , we know a japanese paid . EOS
SOS it could do very differently . EOS
SOS the resources are sort of the resources , and that 's why the resources are not going and not work . EOS
SOS and you 've got to get all your favorite minds to work in order to respect , health , infrastructure without growth . EOS
SOS but that 's because you need a little bit of work . EOS . EOS
SOS that means , on the end , more or less , or less , can be able to work in this direction , we can work better , we can think of as businesses as businesses we need right products , services than consumers , what we really need , how are we going to do so EOS
SOS what do we need and what we need to be ? EOS
SOS right ? i want to choose the right public policy , which is going to transport
SOS some of the reasons i gave . EOS
SOS and finally , of course , the science of all the science , all the science , all of the world is still happening , how can we fix the growth ? EOS ? EOS
SOS but unfortunately , nobody did . EOS
SOS if you look at the site , if you look at the development of the last 20 years , it 's always going down because it 's not going . EOS
SOS politics ca n't make the policy , and the evidence is not going to get growth , but that 's the question , how do we go to the world , and that 's because we have a good life of it ? EOS
SOS so , it 's doing it . EOS
SOS if you want to get to the top , you get to lake . EOS
SOS with heart , brain , my hand , and finally , is going to take the brakes on the stage . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS i 'm going to skip on a ride . EOS
SOS and i love this town . EOS
SOS so this city has so many stories . EOS
SOS one of them happened a few hundred years ago . EOS
SOS and it has to do with creative problem . EOS
SOS i 'm going to get on that creative problem , and the story is something later . EOS
SOS it 's going to be done with the highway . EOS
SOS so this is going to skip back to the middle of this city , and a lot of this city has also been happening and also . EOS
SOS another story . EOS
SOS it was in a hot summer street street , pennsylvania . EOS
SOS one man shows how to put it in his shoes so that it really happens . EOS
SOS it 's too warm . EOS
SOS he 's smart , he does n't know that . EOS
SOS he 's doing one of them , he 's wearing the room from a hole , not a long drop in the size , and it takes lots of holes in there . EOS
SOS he puts the back up to the head , and he shows a new climate in the room . EOS
SOS it 's that , it 's born . EOS
SOS and this number , which you 're seeing here is the scene in the front of the guerrilla today . EOS
SOS a company is designed designed with four letters . EOS
SOS one of them knows it . EOS
SOS he has the original idea that he should have grown and offered . EOS
SOS they both have taken . EOS
SOS so he says , well , i 'll do my own business . EOS
SOS he goes into the stock market . EOS
SOS today today , several thousand employees have been in high business in the world today . EOS
SOS so that 's a lot of the subject problem . EOS
SOS why not invent something new , which is n't there ? EOS
SOS and then finally , maybe the question was going to give up with you . EOS
SOS if you 're not even familiar with them , it 's a chance ? EOS
SOS and this is a question that has helped me many situations . EOS
SOS when things go wrong or my crew or work does n't work or whatever . EOS
SOS memory , little memory , way . EOS
SOS what is the opportunity ? EOS
SOS and you 've already come from the back to the reserve . EOS
SOS what i can do that is what i can discuss with this example . EOS
SOS and another example of that had been collected from the wild industry , and it would be the same case of death . EOS
SOS and the evidence of how creative people can be able to do when it comes to their own insurance . EOS
SOS i want to show you a few examples here . EOS
SOS so they 're actually the sort of designed done with the shell , and they made it out as well . EOS
SOS i love my fantastic . EOS
SOS my son did n't let it . EOS
SOS it 's easy for me to get the woman through the cursor . EOS
SOS or i had my entire day plants when i reached the prison , and suddenly , i grew up , i could n't see the other car . EOS
SOS all right , who is to blame , right ? EOS
SOS the bush . EOS
SOS the patrollers are curved . EOS
SOS i 'd have a gamer , and i 'll almost die . EOS
SOS now , you can do that at least half a calculator . EOS
SOS i did n't want to blame that crash . EOS
SOS blame was the young woman in the safari . EOS
SOS if you 're a man , any more explanation will happen . EOS
SOS but if you are a woman , they do n't understand it . EOS
SOS so people are creative , we are creative . EOS
SOS and i wish i and dreams we all use more of this creativity . EOS
SOS many of us are in a plantation . EOS
SOS and that does n't need to be that way . EOS
SOS why not make things happen ? EOS
SOS there 's old things that we do , which may be used to become the spring , which maybe we might have been left or as the opposite . EOS
SOS why not just make it differently , which is going through as small as a little bit . EOS
SOS and there 's that , there are so many companies doing this . EOS
SOS for example , for example , they 've got these positions in their business , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there might be something like this . EOS
SOS one way , right ? EOS
SOS let 's go with the coffee instead of the day . EOS
SOS or something . EOS
SOS we do n't have any system here . EOS
SOS is n't it today , right ? EOS
SOS if you can let that mobile phone ca n't put something like anything . EOS
SOS or eat it up to me , we 'll use both . EOS
SOS marcus , but creative . EOS
SOS that takes something . EOS
SOS i would like to talk about one of the clients or the police who would go and say , okay , i like that . EOS
SOS that 's what i call that . EOS
SOS a hundred percent of it has been the current side of the current , and it is in the daytime . EOS
SOS once again , the current news , all of politics . EOS
SOS if you were there that there was three times the time you 're in charge . EOS
SOS and once again , they were able to eat the ceiling over the long . EOS
SOS it 's a distributed building , and the restaurant is very small , so the students all had to do full hands . EOS
SOS it was too heavy . EOS
SOS they 've got thinking , in all , what do we do ? EOS
SOS how do we solve the problem ? EOS
SOS we ca n't get faster in the kitchen . EOS
SOS this idea is created . EOS
SOS at each table , there is going to be a famous day that 's going to fall in the head of fresh salt , missouri and amjad . EOS
SOS so , in fact , if there 's been in the waiting for food , you 've been able to step down . EOS
SOS just a bit different . EOS
SOS it 's a creative idea , and maybe you can have the population . EOS
SOS there 's a person in the power right now . EOS
SOS it 's that person 's the leader of the colony , so the owner of the owner . EOS
SOS and now in the end of the day , the german bubble . EOS
SOS already the second day , which is going to take over , so four days . EOS
SOS a company has had a researcher on the staff of the month , and you know , maybe that . EOS
SOS a magician says , rather , we thank you . EOS
SOS people are coming to us . EOS
SOS the coal reefs are filled ; it 's going to be done in the world , people will move to each other because of course , looking for others from a b . EOS
SOS but why does n't even go and create a little bit of something that does something like that ? EOS
SOS sometimes it happens also creativity also . EOS
SOS and it comes out of a context as if you know about this organization you may know . EOS
SOS so we realized that if you do n't really want that , you do n't really want it very well , but you have to have to save that in the case , but a little bit . EOS
SOS or you can use it in the car . EOS
SOS there we know the different , and the ones , and all kinds of directions . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS why not a piece of state into the car when you go to ? EOS
SOS or there is also ways to create creative . EOS
SOS and all of this has just about humor with humor , with joy , with times , is it stupid ? EOS
SOS sometimes it 's funny . EOS
SOS once my home son was in my office . EOS
SOS and i 'm sitting on this session . EOS
SOS so , we 've run a series around the board . EOS
SOS and then he goes from left to the right , he has joy , and i read it in my career , `` you , that 's not a playground here . EOS
SOS he 's looking at me , look at that big eyes . EOS
SOS and in the moment , i 'm actually saying it right , right ? EOS
SOS why is n't that a playground ? EOS
SOS why is that what we do , not the playground for adults ? EOS
SOS so that 's much more , right ? EOS
SOS if we 're acting , when we use our talents to do what we like to do . EOS
SOS and with that , you can get it , but it 's kind of bizarre .
SOS the key thing is that if there 's a certain day of the week , then it changes your brain . EOS
SOS it 's the first day in the week , and somehow , our focus is on a different day . EOS
SOS that 's another day we 've been looking for . EOS
SOS that 's how it goes back in the world .
SOS you 've also heard about it already . EOS
SOS on the edge of the day , there 's only one day until the weekend . EOS
SOS or as then the most beautiful time of the year of the year , on board . EOS . EOS
SOS so , what are the other people 's weeks of the year ? EOS
SOS is it so terrible ? EOS
SOS do we all have that terrible jobs ? EOS
SOS one of the things we had was going on about it , this topic . EOS
SOS yes , okay , i can do the rest and the rest of you . EOS
SOS or on facebook , on facebook , all over the social networks , this topic will be . EOS . EOS
SOS once i was walking through the lens , one of the calving control . EOS
SOS there 's a lot of businesses , and i look like i liked . EOS . EOS
SOS so what 's going on in the cloud , what 's there ? EOS
SOS and one day , i was going to buy this business with those sign . EOS
SOS and the first sign you see here , yeah , is actually very nice . EOS
SOS so , from doing that . instead of working . EOS
SOS i 've also talked about this -- my father 's father , but i love my work now . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS or most importantly , according to the side of the road , there is the commercial sign .
SOS why is it that personal faith , which is always more and more and more . EOS
SOS someone has an answer to this direction , it 's not on top ; it 's your jobs . EOS
SOS and i 'm actually going to ask the pink , go here and say , okay , okay , go ahead . EOS
SOS what about my job is beautiful ? EOS
SOS this is stupid , even if it 's the pink , it looks like before . EOS
SOS so a nice thing to talk about it is n't beautiful , does n't seem . EOS
SOS the pink glasses are actually great to drive . EOS
SOS there 's a wonderful place going to land in the eye . EOS
SOS but they do n't get rid of them . EOS
SOS where does this lead us if we do n't change that ? EOS
SOS in fact , the job , the content , the content ? EOS ? EOS
SOS in the company , outside of the company . EOS
SOS it might end in a system where we feel like the mouse . EOS
SOS the mouse is going to go into this hole and walk and walk and goes , and eventually it will get to the poor mouse and get out out . EOS
SOS what does the mouse do ? EOS
SOS they do n't know anything else ; it goes back in the back . EOS
SOS and again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again
SOS that 's pretty close to here with it , so it 's doing there , and there 's always over and over again . EOS
SOS and that 's what we think of as a funny person 's likely to beat the man at one ? EOS
SOS or something that 's going to happen to you . EOS
SOS i went back to the many years ago when i was at a dinner home . EOS
SOS and it turned out to me in the street , felt that it was very black in my eyes , and somehow i got to stay . EOS
SOS the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , `` what 's going on ? EOS
SOS he looked at me and said , `` no way , everything is okay . EOS
SOS but what about the finance ? EOS ? EOS
SOS and i looked up in my calendar to see this , and i 'd worked three weeks , and i kind of became the job . EOS
SOS after 20 years of the family students and the participants who started wondering whether we can finally last night at night . EOS
SOS i 've also thought , well , what else is there for jobs ? EOS
SOS and i began to show you , to look at other priorities , to see that i spent time with my family , something good for myself . EOS
SOS but you know if there 's nothing else else in my job , a new channel . EOS . EOS
SOS i 've discovered the talks of large groups of groups , which are very joy . EOS . EOS
SOS i 'm going to go like i 'm fired and i 'm going to give other kinds of other things , but these conversations , but i 'll give these talks , to experience , to experience , to experience experiences that are willing to get really joy .
SOS and that was n't always the case . EOS
SOS i 've got to realize that this makes a lot of effort gets sick . EOS
SOS and sometimes the thing takes place before the front of me , from the hospital , after he has a heart attack , and he starts again . EOS
SOS in the early days , when i said , you walk with me , he always talked about it , yes , you 're going to walk with your walk . EOS
SOS today he goes . EOS
SOS so , with it , beautiful slowly slowly in the right , but eventually we 're going to go together in time . EOS
SOS what happens ? EOS
SOS we 're going to get all the healthier healthier . EOS
SOS you go down down , but a curve , which is , the conditions of mental health . EOS
SOS five percent of the four percent in the last 10 years of the last 10 years , the rate of almost 15 percent , which is pretty beautiful . EOS . EOS
SOS growth of the federal diseases of obesity diseases , EOS
SOS that 's something i think must that be ? EOS
SOS why is that ? EOS
SOS is this just in venice ? EOS
SOS no , even in germany , it 's like that . EOS
SOS mtt , that 's the problem , that 's all going to be healthier . EOS
SOS that 's shown here on the left . EOS
SOS at the bottom , 70 percent of the last seven hundred percent within the last 10 years , there 's a major german wave out there . EOS
SOS so the number of the waste of the infections of the drug industry is taking
SOS it 's also the cost . EOS
SOS and it looks all possible , which can we do this topic ? EOS
SOS now , for example , some of these things are going to occur as well as for example . EOS
SOS so it 's good . EOS
SOS and somebody said , no alcohol , no solution . EOS
SOS but what is the solution ? EOS
SOS what is that , again , what makes us healthy and full and fun with happiness ? EOS
SOS and that 's what i 've been doing for the last couple . EOS
SOS i 've got thinking , like , is something like this , can you do this ? EOS
SOS i 'm a believer , the job is not what makes us and happy to do . EOS
SOS there are many other things that are important , family , health , and so on . EOS
SOS but in fact , we 're going to spend the biggest part of our work in work . EOS
SOS and if we do that , why do n't we do that , it 's fun to us and other people . EOS
SOS i mean , i 'm going to give you down to them in a last minute , so that 's how to drive and to the end of it . EOS
SOS these little psychiatrists , which then then hopefully will be easier . EOS
SOS in addition to talent , freedom and environment . EOS
SOS that means , how do i do my creativity ? EOS
SOS in the environment , i am like this , including who ? EOS
SOS what i do is i mean to do what i want to do ? EOS
SOS because it 's the degree of accuracy that we 're moving to . EOS
SOS the more of them , the more stress . EOS
SOS and what do i do ? EOS
SOS they do it . EOS . EOS
SOS that 's where these four are areas . EOS
SOS and you can see it for yourself . EOS
SOS i had to do this for myself a couple of years ago , and i always do again again . EOS
SOS can i use my talents ? EOS
SOS in the environment ? EOS
SOS and that means , sometimes i move into a submarine with my laptop , to take the child credit or a toy . EOS
SOS the freedom . EOS
SOS which is the freedom i can take you to do what i 'm important . EOS
SOS and do i do it ? EOS
SOS they do it . EOS . EOS
SOS the last weekend . EOS
SOS and then there are always people who tell me why not . EOS
SOS and why that 's a lot harder . EOS
SOS and then i 've been doing an answer to this place . EOS
SOS who wants to find ways . EOS
SOS who does n't have reasons . EOS
SOS and by the way , you can choose , i think , `` i want you to get a look or i am ? EOS ? EOS
SOS and they 'll be in both . EOS
SOS so what do we do with our conservation ? EOS
SOS now , each of them has seen his great responsibilities . EOS
SOS it 's much too small . EOS
SOS this is filled with beef , with gold , with everything , with your skills . EOS
SOS so what do we do ? EOS
SOS by the end of the year we 're asking . EOS . EOS
SOS or if we 're in the hospital or the end of a life . EOS
SOS what did i do with my prescription ? EOS
SOS by the way , who 's here today has been here on this side , can still be here before . EOS
SOS so , what do we do with our talent is so my first question , even with me , and it 's every day . EOS
SOS do i do the good enough ? EOS
SOS and resources . EOS
SOS there was another story with a story . EOS
SOS i just tell you about that . EOS
SOS and that 's what i 'm doing . EOS
SOS and this bubble was to rescue the rescue of the year , as a result ago at the last time . EOS
SOS and the enemies then realized that it was so good that you could not take them . EOS
SOS thick walls going down to the highway , clean doors , and it 's safe . EOS
SOS it was back then . EOS
SOS so we thought , okay , if we did n't get inside it , we 're going to build a flight . EOS
SOS we do n't leave any more out there . EOS . EOS
SOS now let 's look at how long i do that . EOS
SOS they kept it from the long before the day , where they were almost used to be used . EOS
SOS they only had one more , which was already on the way to get back to the sidewalk , and take one more of these me and give me three days . EOS
SOS rod : all right , you 've got your mind , i 'll leave you , come on , take the breath , you take us . EOS
SOS so we go away with the final path . EOS
SOS on the left at the bottom as the wall of the sun is a monopoly , it will run back from left to the left , and at the early age . EOS
SOS well , think of that , a servant , which is that . EOS
SOS it 's embarrassing . EOS
SOS again , it will be a bit like , standing on top of the wall , this guy 's room black . EOS
SOS bless you think , oh , that 's two , it can still take a difference . EOS
SOS the final day , the same scenario , this time , he knows the plate that 's going on . EOS
SOS at the end of the second day , after the six of the six , you have turned down in a pan . EOS . EOS
SOS because they thought it takes us too long , that we do n't think anymore . EOS
SOS after that after the storm goes down to the side of the jungle , the flight stops . EOS
SOS one that they had , and they 've had it . EOS
SOS and that 's where we went out to be generated . EOS .
SOS i love this idea that everything we need , and we all have it . EOS
SOS sometimes it 's time resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's very little . EOS
SOS but again , we can do something . EOS
SOS we have no idea of what we 've created the world every day . EOS
SOS and if you think that might be a good thing to be right now . EOS
SOS in the spring of the spring of the spring . EOS
SOS it 's coming . EOS
SOS and we know that there 's going to be over the snow , and then it will start getting warmer to green degrees , to green . EOS . EOS
SOS these are where some of them come from these boats . EOS . EOS
SOS and there 's this guy where we harvest it and eat food . EOS
SOS there 's plenty of that grain that 's grain of that grain , and then we can make and bread bread . EOS
SOS there are any animals that eat the food . EOS
SOS there 's people who are going to take the food away . EOS
SOS and it comes . EOS
SOS but if you think about it , maybe it 's not that light is that you 're not going to get it all that way you 're going to get it away . EOS
SOS and of course , that threat may be just very abstract , but also , but also , in the area of the fashion bees , the connection to the plant in the plant form a very , very important . EOS
SOS there are the research that show that up to the depths of the food , as we have had nothing bees . EOS , if we did n't have bees . EOS
SOS now , it sounds like that , because it 's so normal for us , and we do n't like bees . EOS
SOS there was a very interesting movie movie now , and it gave me a very interesting movie , and it gave me a very interesting movie . EOS
SOS and i assure you , look at it . EOS
SOS but now we 're going to look at the latest course of the fact that we just work with bees who 's in his high school , where the meaning of bees does EOS . EOS
SOS this is what he does here at a school at a school , and he 's going to tell a lot about his work . EOS
SOS please stop . EOS
SOS yes , good evening . EOS
SOS first of all , a big thank you at mr. and the whole thing . EOS
SOS i 'm going to show up here with my project , because life is going to give something to the lives of bees . EOS
SOS and also , one of the wing of another thing that has a little bit about little work is that makes fun fun . EOS
SOS because i suppose that the best of you are going to do it today is to be doing today today to want to bring in the order of movement . EOS
SOS i do n't like that . no . EOS
SOS but it may be , maybe i 'll get to convince you that i want to get you to love these things , or you create a kind of empathy to them , and to get them for this kind of thing , called the wind of the gun . EOS
SOS my name is thomas gelehun , i 'm a young woman with my wonderful wife , father of five of children still have n't seen , and i 've done a lot of nights and i 've been working through with children 's child and adults . EOS
SOS i 'm a member of the day of the day , and i 'm going to drive to the side of light . EOS
SOS and now in the end today , we 're talking about the oldest children on the reserve . EOS
SOS we 're working in the garden , in agriculture and in management . EOS . EOS
SOS in fact , you know , you 're actually a video of a child 's now , and it 's about to play . EOS
SOS so our flying classroom is a very , very quiet , a quiet thing . EOS
SOS and she gets for quiet . EOS
SOS it 's almost an urgent matter . EOS
SOS and it 's not for free to have the ancient , so the relationship between the connection between the honey and the prophet of the resistance . EOS . EOS
SOS and in fact , in a wonderful quote , he 's explaining how he 's going to take his elbow at this film , to inspire him that he can do it again again . EOS
SOS but if you go there , there 's nothing in the mouth , but you send them to send your blue bees and now as well as well as well as the result of the lips , with the lips , and you put them in your mouth and over again . EOS later later the words EOS
SOS a beautiful picture . EOS
SOS hopefully this is evening . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS this flying classroom . EOS
SOS i come to the project . EOS
SOS one of these rovers , this one of these things that i just built my students together with me is coming up for 30 to five days in a year . EOS
SOS in fact , in 1967 schools of school students , or into their homes , in the presence of their family , or the rate of death . EOS
SOS a train or a shower to be in venice , as well . EOS
SOS the teacher who 's going on this project is going to take me to the class , and we 're looking for a place for that . EOS
SOS in fact , the window can see something like this month . EOS
SOS and in front of all the things that the bees can put in there , and then inside the tube can be able to melt . EOS
SOS there will be the windows in the window . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS and then the whole thing begins to me is on this . EOS
SOS so i 'm going to take a look like this , and i 'm going to make you out of a $ sample of this room , and now i 'm going to show you here in this tube here . EOS
SOS so what 's important about that on these shelves are actually bees bees . EOS
SOS and also the important thing we 've got over here tonight , and here we have to be here on the edge of there , so fresh eggs . EOS
SOS and then you also see a flight up there . EOS
SOS there 's the honey inside the honey . EOS
SOS you need it if you do n't fly bad , you ca n't fly . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS this is what it looks like . EOS
SOS and then the experimenter comes down here at a moment , and immediately 's starting to pull down to the ground or to live in school . EOS
SOS and now i 'm doing something wonderful . EOS
SOS ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there in the class , there 's a crisis . EOS
SOS their people do n't exist anymore . EOS
SOS they 're frozen . EOS
SOS they do n't find their queen . EOS
SOS and that 's the most important task of the process when he makes this argument that he realized that the queen 's queen has gone through the old people . EOS
SOS so that 's not on these two shelves . EOS
SOS and they get sad , these bees . EOS
SOS they start to tap together . EOS
SOS yes , the name says it , she eats . EOS
SOS you hear that . EOS
SOS they seem to close to a higher higher higher than they normally in their homes with a queen . EOS
SOS and now i 'm going to start a bow . EOS
SOS ladies and gentlemen , in a night , you 're now going to have the need to take a new people , and all of the things happening without no end , of course , with no performance , without having conversations , without studying EOS . EOS
SOS here 's the people , and then the one thing that 's happening in the first night here . EOS
SOS because without the queen , that people would n't exist after six weeks . EOS
SOS because just six weeks long . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS and in that first night , they get a pen out of a pen , and put that into that tube . EOS
SOS and then then there 's going to be done by the queen . EOS
SOS anybody who has been working in high school , says how to walk ? EOS
SOS so yes , we get rid of food , but now you 're genetically genetically . EOS
SOS that 's true . EOS
SOS and now i 'm doing something wonderful . EOS
SOS now , this is a little bit of the only thing that usually happened in the order of an accident in a queen 's queen . EOS
SOS and the english english has the first three days of the genetic code of the sun . EOS
SOS after that , it will lay down to a stranger . EOS . EOS
SOS you know this term . EOS
SOS and immediately , on this level , it changes on the genetic side of genetic code . EOS
SOS it 's going to transform the way through the trajectory in the 1960s . EOS
SOS we 've heard that before that we eat what we eat what we eat . EOS us . EOS
SOS and the queen is really wonderful to experience . EOS
SOS three days later , five days . EOS
SOS and these are students doing everything . EOS
SOS you see that in the classroom . EOS . EOS
SOS and then this cell is going to be connected with a chess stream , and that 's not happening , because the people are now going to have to do a lot of the cell with a gps system , and that 's not happening , because the people are now going to have to do a lot of the cell with a gps system , and that 's not happening , because the people now
SOS no , that happens . EOS
SOS ladies and gentlemen , that 's a bacchanal or a spine . EOS
SOS and then the students eight days of all of my students know three five eight months a queen makes a queen so many days for that . EOS
SOS and the day , if that 's going to happen , the teacher is driving the nobel prize on the back , because in the case , there 's the call people in the morning at five o'clock . EOS
SOS and then the mother says , `` tell me , what about you ? EOS
SOS yes i got to school . EOS
SOS yes , why ? EOS
SOS yes , our queen . EOS
SOS yes ? EOS
SOS and then the morning is in the morning . EOS
SOS and then they 're going to press their trajectory at that rate , because they want to get a part of the queen now . EOS
SOS and if you really experience that , then they 'll hear something . EOS
SOS this queen , EOS . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS a bit higher . EOS
SOS and then you get the brakes , and make these queen free . EOS
SOS the first thing that this queen does is they take their wings , and there are now , with a queen which has a queen , their smell , their intellect , their mortgage . EOS
SOS the people now has an identity . EOS
SOS now for three to five days , this queen has suffered . EOS
SOS you 'll get the back at the front at the top . EOS
SOS back in the back comes out of it from the people , from that . EOS
SOS and after five days , these days are made out of the way . EOS
SOS some people are now , yes , i 've seen this kind of thing a day . EOS . EOS
SOS stop . EOS
SOS which is completely different . EOS
SOS so that 's what we 're doing . EOS
SOS this is the queen that flies that flies alone with no cell , without the ones coming up to two kilometers . EOS
SOS you 've certainly seen it in your calendar . EOS
SOS it 's going to be in the 1960s , and there 's a sudden about seven to 12 drones that male bees bees . EOS
SOS so the other way , as in islam , where the man has different women here is the queen , the seven to 12 men . EOS
SOS and that 's all happening in a wonderful way . EOS
SOS the drone comes from the back that the queen , and now this queen is going to do all of the things they need to raise for three years of their eggs . EOS
SOS it 's also an amazing experience . EOS
SOS if you finished the finished , you die and you fall dead in the sky . EOS
SOS and then the queen comes back and starts to put eggs . EOS
SOS there is always one , two students in the class who are immediately watching that . EOS
SOS they also see the queen . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS and then finally slowly slowly , the project is going back to the side of school , and now it 's going to drive down to the queen and the queen 's queen , and you 'll get this now into that right now . EOS
SOS and then i get one night back to that evening . EOS
SOS so this is from the outside of the outside , and the next morning , i went out of this with the queen and i made these bees with the heel . EOS
SOS and there you see the queen . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS slow . EOS . EOS
SOS and it 's mostly 10 to 12 to 12 . EOS
SOS and then that yes , these two peaks are coming here in a sample . EOS
SOS in a full ball , in a distance and now , this will be big and powerful . EOS
SOS why bees in school ? EOS
SOS ladies and gentlemen , the kids who experienced this , forget that no more . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS it 's not only that in this class , the students all the time are together with the bees , but the whole school comes into that class . EOS
SOS and the teachers he knows when he knows something if he can put something he up there is a period of the others . EOS
SOS look at the bees , bees and thousands of thousands of years ago , we have a row where people already have the honey . EOS
SOS a few months ago , a few months ago in israel , we found that people back in israel , EOS
SOS any human culture has covered with bees . EOS
SOS or the other way the bees were at any culture . EOS
SOS in china , in india in cameroon , in egypt , in seattle in rome . EOS
SOS they were everywhere . EOS
SOS the human cultures ladies ladies and gentlemen , are gone . EOS
SOS he can express a bridge , a camera , and he can express a frequency . EOS
SOS ladies and gentlemen , you know , you know , what are flowers , or trees , what you need ? EOS
SOS you can find something out there now , in the summer in agriculture . EOS
SOS that 's out there , that 's a green desert for our bees . EOS
SOS yes ? EOS
SOS he can go back to the students in the movies , and there are hundreds of bees going to go up and see how long they need now from now to my flowers ? EOS
SOS how long are you in the individuals ? EOS
SOS and how long they need to come back till they come back . EOS
SOS he can reach for a while . EOS
SOS how am i going to be a ticket ? EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS you know , if that is that the peak is up to the top , or is on the top flat side ? EOS
SOS look at that . EOS
SOS he can create a mathematics -- a servant . EOS
SOS yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can even find the same pressure on these shelves . EOS
SOS and then he comes to the question of how did what did the nobel nobel prize for all ? EOS
SOS because he chose that the bees would see that . EOS that . EOS . EOS
SOS but ladies and gentlemen , in one spot , it 's exploded . EOS
SOS there 's also a bee there . EOS
SOS and just by the professor , many years at the university of teaching , who taught it to the government , that the bees bees can make a base on individuals . EOS
SOS as a result of how to make the web net out of the dopamine to the balcony , and now , with more likely , you have the contact out there , and the bees , the ones , the ones that are carrying your legs with your legs , and with your EOS . EOS
SOS see what these bees do in school ? EOS
SOS it 's delicious , and the kids are losing their fear of bees . EOS
SOS and develop a role for bees bees . EOS
SOS they learn how to do what the bees do . EOS
SOS and you get a sense of what these beings are basically just alive for us . EOS
SOS the bees do n't create a tenth of a people in the year . EOS
SOS so many years ago , the only way to make toast . EOS
SOS they are collecting the areas in the local trees . EOS
SOS this is a passage , which is the effect of her people . EOS
SOS and now imagine a summer , these are spectacular -- like bees in such a dense space , at the same time . EOS
SOS hey , there 's no photoshop there . EOS
SOS no , not in bees . EOS
SOS because they have natural antibiotics in this natural natural antibiotics . EOS
SOS they collect the pollen , and it 's going to push him down , he will collect it to a halt , a high school . EOS
SOS someone who 's grown up with the food 's orbit is to speak up , and now that can go to a flying trip , and to take a joint partner by using the people out of the people . EOS
SOS of course , there 's a grid in front of it , and with flying along with a gps page , and so on . EOS there . EOS
SOS yes , and then ladies and gentlemen , even though of course , that 's what the bees will , of course , and we would have less apple if the bees ca n't fly around or we would have to like the chinese to the EOS , and they EOS
SOS there 's a lot more there . EOS
SOS if you look at the bar , there 's out on the x-axis , which is also where the cows burst . EOS
SOS and then the bee sits there , and then he moves down , and he sits into this platform . EOS
SOS and now the cow comes to the side , and it 's only because you can remove your plate , you can beat it . EOS
SOS yes ? EOS
SOS and then they go back and see it , ah , yes , i 've got off , ah , i can blow it back . EOS
SOS and then there 's milk . EOS
SOS that makes the mind . EOS
SOS yes ? EOS
SOS and at the end of the last day , that 's the most significant thing that exists in nature . EOS
SOS the honey . EOS
SOS i want to get a moment to the point . EOS
SOS my students would build each year and then eventually come to me in the schools . EOS
SOS now i do n't know that now , but i had a student in the school , and i said , i said , in the wake of school in the school , i said , you know , `` you 're going to do , you know , do n't put yourself yourself . EOS
SOS and then he says , `` yes , i throw it hot . EOS
SOS i 'm going to talk from i 'm at princeton and i 'm a sixth years . EOS
SOS and i 've been in the age for five years since now , and since two years now in the van . EOS
SOS and i 'm glad i ca n't learn today anymore , but with your hands . EOS
SOS it 's like , yes . EOS . EOS
SOS and one of them went through the 1960s , high school school . EOS
SOS and more than half of them said , oh , that 's what we want . EOS
SOS my students in my students is an extraordinary challenge , and the gap between , in venezuela , about normal and the older people are eaten by the bees . EOS
SOS at the time you 're going to go and get your mind , my students and a certain pride . EOS
SOS how do you get to mind ? EOS
SOS the question is wrong . EOS
SOS you have to say , how do you deal with that ? EOS
SOS and i think that 's because , there 's a man who will give other people up there and give him a new frontier . EOS
SOS and he says , `` do so start with that . EOS
SOS at the end of a small poem , i mean a little poem . EOS
SOS and who 's like the bee would feel that the sun will feel the sun through the surface , and never the way to lose the fields of the fields at the fields of the fields as soon as he lived in a while he would EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS hi , dear friends in the world . EOS
SOS welcome to my project 's project . EOS
SOS the project of my father and my wife . EOS
SOS it 's the fight for a third day . EOS
SOS in my view of humanity 's greatest crime , because it has been around for years . EOS
SOS it 's a society for women with still who else . EOS
SOS first of all , i 'll imagine . EOS
SOS my name is drunk , i come from alabama . EOS
SOS that 's where i went on a million years ago . EOS
SOS you can not have the job . EOS
SOS i did n't feel like it . EOS
SOS and that 's why i was glad that i could move into the subject of doing that well , and then i could pull more and more exciting . EOS
SOS for example . EOS
SOS with a massive spread across the atlantic border . EOS
SOS at the expense of the election at the order of brazil , genocide at the last quarter of the last season , they were able to prevent the attack . EOS
SOS this was a trip where i was more than a half , more than a speech . EOS
SOS but nevertheless , these were the kind of ways of being able to find interest in the media and even a small person , as i could bring it to the language . EOS
SOS now , as i was , by the way , i was involved in ethiopia , which i was based on
SOS back in the back , there was war between the u.k. and ethiopia , and we were left on that street station . EOS
SOS and despite all the time that we had , we had to put on the other side of the earth 's surface , the evolutionary sequence of the pipeline that we face , in fact , arabic . EOS
SOS and twice it was that we 'd been collected and , and our two colleagues that you see here with their bodies as being living on us , and the furniture said that they are my favorite . EOS
SOS if you want to shoot the killing you need to shoot your through this . EOS
SOS something like i found in any other culture . EOS
SOS and at that time , in young years , learned that you could not reduce islam from terrorism . EOS
SOS now , christians do n't want to be reduced to their terrorism . EOS
SOS for example , for example . EOS
SOS the patrollers , the giraffes . EOS . EOS
SOS but rather than the true values , as well , social responsibility . EOS
SOS these are the values for which to fight . EOS
SOS after many years , i went back to this session , with my wife , EOS
SOS and then we heard about this from this comic female female . EOS
SOS when i heard that 93 percent of our daily victims , the trees are christians , and as i did , i thought , how can a disconnect such as islam , who are still going to pick up with the shoes ? EOS
SOS and the idea was to explain the highest leaders of islam to explain in the book . EOS
SOS we were doing it with german organizations that we did n't find . EOS
SOS now we had to hear that we probably would be completely anxious , that islam is n't always the case . EOS
SOS you would beat me to the mast . EOS
SOS at the end of the u.k. international , we launched our own organization . EOS
SOS and they were surrounded by both and independent conditions . EOS
SOS and in order to get this battle , at all , we needed images . EOS
SOS there was a lack of lack of life . EOS
SOS and that 's why i moved back to this desert to make those images . EOS
SOS the bad pictures of pictures i 'm not going to do not show you but i want to get the crime away . EOS
SOS girl in the age of four weeks to the back of their parents , all of their parents and their relatives , on the earth , on the earth , you 're going to put on the limbs , and you actually control them with the oil and the dirt and the EOS
SOS and what you 're going to do is take a base of the size of a millimeter . EOS
SOS now this is going to give you a banana . EOS
SOS if you get your rule , it 's two weeks . EOS
SOS durkheim lost their bodies and soul , their dignity . EOS
SOS that was the beginning of what we 're doing about . EOS . EOS
SOS it goes on . EOS
SOS the man has to open it . EOS
SOS he never saw a woman woman . EOS
SOS the experimenter told him , `` oh , '' is n't a problem . EOS
SOS you put your penis up with you , and you end up hard . EOS
SOS and if you ca n't make it , it 's not bad . EOS
SOS and then you take the knife and knocks it . EOS
SOS that 's delicious . EOS
SOS that 's when a third of the girl dies . EOS
SOS they had three months ago . EOS
SOS otherwise the girl had lost his language . EOS
SOS these are the organizers , too few in asia . EOS
SOS most of them are conservative meat . EOS
SOS and when we were muslims , why did we do that ? EOS
SOS and the final answer was that we need to do that , that 's in the koran . EOS
SOS nothing is in the koran . it 's quite the opposite . EOS
SOS each of our people 's five thousand every day in their hands , as usual , the creator , is perfect , running . EOS
SOS but you do n't seem to believe in what you believe . EOS
SOS they 're trying to join a life that has been wrong , and why you might be as a person , as a person , on women . EOS
SOS but now we had the images of the first draft of the first to this . EOS
SOS he invites us to have a conference at a conference . EOS
SOS it was hard for me for two days . EOS
SOS but we had the peace on our side of our side , the highest distance on our side . EOS
SOS and then the great choice , which is the power against all human rights against religion , we have to beat him . EOS
SOS as far as the last year , the new century began to cover . EOS
SOS and if you know africa , and you know , only that 's for these people . EOS
SOS and it has been , and these successes , we had other countries in other countries . EOS
SOS well , for example , here we are speaking about the highest rule , the death of the country , his message , that it 's a crime , to write up to write it and to carry it into the olympics . EOS
SOS we were back on the road . EOS
SOS we had a hundred to them . EOS
SOS and where we came from , we have only open ears open , open arms , and the historical holy , the historic of gold . EOS
SOS and as we wanted to leave the country , the great boom and the pig , you really want to leave all the children in the country ? EOS
SOS that 's not going to give you any other . EOS
SOS he 's right . EOS
SOS i 'm a geek , and there 's got to be slowly . EOS
SOS and most importantly , he had an idea . EOS
SOS he said if you 're going to get to bring the ten to the 10 to the world , to bring a table to the table , then it 's a box . EOS
SOS and i 'm going to go and go to the lobby , and i 'd like to see it in sound with the shell of the other . EOS
SOS and in the end of the day , for example , on the very end , his beloved professor doctor gave us a banana . EOS
SOS he heard about the idea of it as well , especially as we used to give him this out . EOS
SOS and that 's what we 're going to do is to support us . EOS
SOS and then he said , i 'm not just going to talk about the conference as we asked him , but i 'm going to take them over . EOS
SOS and that 's what he did . EOS
SOS over 12,000 years , our depression will lay our bodies . EOS
SOS international estimates of the death of women 's female 's female body . EOS
SOS under the 1930s of the senate , professor doctor signed smoking . EOS
SOS and they all came . EOS
SOS a hundred hundred years , but the world 's highest world . EOS
SOS in the middle of the 1930s of tehran , the man has seen in vienna and in the rest of europe . EOS
SOS so men who live and death can decide . EOS
SOS but also the others . EOS
SOS on the left side , on the right side of the flight , my coauthor . EOS
SOS the world 's top of the world . EOS
SOS i 'm just going to give a look at that moment , and of course , personally . EOS
SOS and then i brought them all . EOS
SOS it started the conference . EOS
SOS and below our sign on the edge of the left from the left . EOS
SOS at the end of the permian egypt , the founder of wife and the winter , germany . EOS
SOS so much to the subject of islam is not that way . EOS
SOS we also had experts also , as long as that , which is why you live women out there . EOS
SOS and then you can see some film on it . EOS
SOS reality . EOS
SOS the men had a separate eyes . EOS
SOS they went back to sea doors only for only two hours , and they decided to write a microphone , a crocodile . EOS
SOS the mid-ocean sits in front of the cameras , and the cameras . EOS . EOS
SOS and the most important sentence in that was this one . EOS
SOS female robinson is a commercial crime that is against the highest values of islam . EOS
SOS he invites the russians . EOS
SOS we thought that was actually done the job , but the absence of the thing is done without our effort . EOS
SOS because the reason to speak about the kindness of the woman has gotten better than any minds . EOS
SOS that 's what we 're going to do . EOS
SOS we 've done this conference in this book in the book book book . EOS
SOS it 's a double for the community of the world . EOS
SOS and it 's because i think it worked so well that we found the book , he 's going to work with it . EOS
SOS it will lay us out of hands . EOS
SOS we had to be in many countries , then in the top of the highest season . EOS . EOS
SOS and they read that with some of them were so excited that they had the book . EOS
SOS but unfortunately , most of them do n't have the courage to say it too . EOS
SOS if you 're not going to talk to the top of the woman . EOS
SOS only some have the courage in it . EOS
SOS they are at least in the universities , in the end . EOS
SOS and in fact , we 've found some pretty strange calculations that actually happened in the 1960s about what here . EOS
SOS and then it goes down to starbucks . EOS . EOS
SOS and these are the individuals . EOS
SOS they will spread it . EOS
SOS but i 'm running time . EOS
SOS it 's all drop out of hot stones , and that 's why i 'm working on a lot of other strategies , this topic . EOS
SOS they practice the practice . EOS
SOS but my motto would be that . EOS
SOS i want to tell you the amazing message of the highest 's top top of the world in the world , by the part of islam , which is at the front of the kaaba in the
SOS it 's not on the same way that 's going to fly , but it 's in the 1960s . EOS
SOS if there 's four million people together , men and women obey islamic health . EOS
SOS and then i went to the end of all of those of those of those at the time king , my mushroom up to the top between gravity . EOS
SOS as i 've used this here , i 've started here to the way . EOS
SOS unfortunately , the last thing is , unfortunately , the last thing that would call the king king . EOS
SOS but i 'm sure he would take away with it . EOS
SOS to help these women . EOS
SOS to the other time , to show the world that the real values of islam are , instead of the time . EOS . EOS
SOS the terrorists as a commodity . EOS
SOS if i could n't do that , then i 'll do this thing in print . EOS
SOS in fact , many of us in the classrooms are in all over the world . EOS
SOS and we could do that in the process . EOS
SOS and maybe i still find that the little girl of his daughters do n't have to raise my daughters anymore . EOS
SOS then my life has been so hard to it . EOS
SOS and i want to say , `` i want everybody who has heard that or has seen . EOS
SOS and again , there 's no way that i 've been able to do a
SOS we need to get into the distance , but you still do n't touch it . EOS
SOS and now i 'd like to show you that i 've been looking for a project of mine . EOS
SOS this is my passport , my coauthor . EOS
SOS and this is in all the five stages in the middle of arabic at the top of the day , and it has to end up . EOS
SOS this is also in german , again . EOS
SOS female robinson is the koran and general designer islam . EOS
SOS it 's wirelessly , and an extension of islam . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS so i just start . EOS
SOS this is what the investigation came from , which had been in germany . EOS
SOS as a result , my mom 's mother , my brother and i got a kind of a piece of training . EOS
SOS it 's delicious . EOS
SOS my mother was totally upset because she did n't understand why we have a lot of food . EOS
SOS the third day we 've finally met . EOS
SOS we stood up in the wind , and then a nine-year-old woman came out , and we would just leave it out against death . EOS
SOS they tried to explain , `` you know , you can eat . EOS
SOS that 's not insignificant . EOS
SOS it tastes pretty well . EOS
SOS it 's cheese . EOS
SOS my mother was raised up high and we were laughing . EOS
SOS cheese . EOS
SOS but in my own country , we have a gps problem , but they did n't smell so . EOS
SOS i 'm a psychologist , and i 'm a half years old . EOS
SOS fourteen years ago i was in my mom with my brother of china to germany . EOS
SOS i 'm going to talk about that business . EOS
SOS but most importantly , it 's all about the people who have been able to make this interface and have a success done . EOS
SOS but first of all , i 'll tell you where i was coming . EOS
SOS i 'm thankful . EOS
SOS and in fact , there 's a small facility running in the middle of china . EOS
SOS and this region is going to be the chinese area called the asian area . EOS
SOS it 's about 12,000 miles away from germany . EOS
SOS in china , there 's 10 million in the workforce , but in cambodia , is the largest commercial community in china . EOS
SOS and that change is why we need to suffer in china under the same time . EOS
SOS hundreds of chinese chinese would have taken away from fossil fuels to our own home to a minority . EOS
SOS our own language , the language of the education system . EOS
SOS in schools and in universities , only chinese will become chinese . EOS
SOS and our religion ca n't get free to it . EOS
SOS the ecx is losing your culture and identity . EOS
SOS and if someone is creative and for the rights of their treatment , they 're going to use less likely to keep overweight or even death . EOS
SOS that was the reason why my parents decided to escape with us . EOS
SOS that was me , and i was 11 years old . EOS
SOS this is a moment ago in the computer . EOS . EOS
SOS we did n't have enough money , so my dad had just left it . EOS
SOS i 've been talking to a lot of people who have helped us in the workforce . EOS
SOS i am a lot of pictures . EOS
SOS i 'm going to skip on . but first of all , we 're going to do our hand . EOS
SOS i 'd like to put it right up when i raise my eyes . EOS
SOS he was at the big speed of the day , and we met him with his little computer on a parking field . EOS
SOS the first rate has been completed . EOS
SOS i know a lot of you have a negative image of the brain , that just do n't make businesses , not interested in the case . EOS . EOS
SOS but i 'd like to say i 'd like to call it as a call , not as a frenchman . EOS
SOS because it has chosen us . EOS
SOS he stood at the airport of the hospital at the airport , and got to the final end of the way we were going to really make sure . EOS . EOS
SOS airport came up with this , and i know how my mother was sort of saying to me just from the airport . EOS
SOS do n't give you . EOS
SOS until we get out . EOS
SOS because i had a look in my hand , and there was also my photo in my hand , but there was a total name . EOS . EOS
SOS i had to speak as an ambassador . EOS . EOS
SOS and i swear , i 'm working on my head of me who had my watch in my hand . EOS
SOS silence . EOS
SOS connection . EOS
SOS a long look . EOS
SOS we were finally going to quit . EOS
SOS in buddhism , i came to a lot of the community who had sort of evolved to us . EOS
SOS i 'm going to speak to the local woman who has used to us with us . EOS
SOS in a $ run with four , per capita families . EOS
SOS at least children 's child . EOS
SOS a servant and a kitchen . EOS
SOS there was strangers faces . EOS
SOS and many different languages . EOS
SOS and we did n't have privacy . EOS
SOS my mom , my brother and i had to share a lot of the speech . EOS
SOS there was eaten , white and homework were done . EOS
SOS so my friends did n't come up to visit because i was where we were flying . EOS
SOS only my favorite work in high school knew it . EOS . EOS
SOS they knew my story , and i was very excited about it . EOS me . EOS
SOS for example , i made it up to you how i do n't do it anymore . EOS
SOS but they also helped me sort of electronics , i also meet them . EOS
SOS i spent my whole career in the calendar . EOS
SOS it was n't easy for my mom . EOS
SOS in fact , with us with children without their husband and in the uncertainty of uncertainty , because we had only had a conversation and could get married . EOS
SOS i 'll conclude i was very , very conservative . EOS
SOS it 's also kind of embarrassing to tell me this now , but now i have to stand with my story . EOS
SOS i was very pleased , and i was basically interested in education . EOS
SOS the one that brought us up to us to ship us when we put the first time with a child 's child . EOS
SOS i 'm normal , i mean , i do n't have to live in a plantation . EOS
SOS i 've also taken myself to get my brother or sent them . EOS
SOS just with that . EOS . EOS
SOS i 've been doing it in multiple ways that were doing with us , because our parents did n't have an epiphany . EOS
SOS or they 've just made with us . EOS
SOS we 're always very happy . EOS
SOS i still know how we always went to the fence and wait until these guys , because somehow we took people out of time , and that was important . EOS
SOS after two years finally , my father came to germany . EOS
SOS the problem was , however , he 'd been pulled away from a lot of sea because there was no room there for him . EOS
SOS and i 'm talking about this very , very , very talented , very unlikely , to get my father before to china , even though he was able to live with us . EOS
SOS i 've been looking at that time , because i really was very , very happy , because after six years of prison , we had finally reach into a regular hospital . EOS
SOS we got a wingspan for three years , and we had finally had a $ home with a own hair and a own kitchen . EOS
SOS and i even had a room . EOS
SOS it was very small , and i had n't had a desk in it , but it was good , i could go back my door . EOS
SOS and i 've been suggesting that i was very good , but i had to leave the high school without a return . EOS
SOS i did n't really look at that perspective . EOS . EOS
SOS there was a passage that has always been around me , and it 's still going to do the idea that i can get across the second one , my second one . EOS
SOS and then first of all , then the children end up .
SOS i thank you the teachers who really believed to me , and i was n't really easy at the time . EOS . EOS
SOS after that , i came to it . EOS
SOS and before i got back to the ward , i was walking along with my best friend . EOS
SOS in addition to this is an organization or a project project . EOS
SOS but i was n't really good at that ; i was just just because we had a place where we could go through . EOS
SOS we had a joint , which we could give away all of our ancestry . EOS
SOS and the head of labor was that we helped him talk about our problems , and he was able to get us out by all questions . EOS
SOS and after that , i went to the ward , i cried . EOS
SOS and that 's a project where young people can get the ability to get in the way . EOS
SOS i really did that very well , and i 've discovered art , art , art , i think , a little bit more . EOS
SOS by the way , by the way , a friend of us came to us . EOS
SOS he made the film over the lives of my friends and me . EOS
SOS and the film won a lot of people . EOS
SOS we realized that people were interested in our history . EOS
SOS he was a very special feeling because we had never experienced that people listening . EOS
SOS and that was a moment where i thought , okay . EOS
SOS i do n't want to cheat anymore . EOS
SOS i want to make something out of my life . EOS
SOS a subset of synesthesia , one of a sudden charity came up to the idea of led to one of the drug to protect . EOS
SOS but since i totally lost as i lost my own building , i 'm going to be on a label , and the title is three to four . EOS
SOS so i was right right . EOS
SOS i played with it . EOS
SOS and the great thing is , after a performance of two minutes , i woke up with that kind of thing . EOS
SOS and asked me , i just had to make your own life . EOS
SOS i thought great , great , wow . EOS
SOS i mean , okay . EOS
SOS and i took it to the end of the hospital now , and now you sit down , and i 'm talking about a play , which i also had , in fact , was the same way to go to the european pole . EOS
SOS and i 've also won him . EOS
SOS now at the moment , i study at college time , and i 've been doing a film that 's happening at the third year , and i 'm on the other side . EOS .
SOS and that would not be possible for me if it was n't any or or organizations like how or projects like or projects like me . EOS
SOS they decided to me , they brought me open spaces , they 've been able to figure out how i can design my place in the society . EOS
SOS and that 's what i 'm going to come to you now . EOS
SOS each of them has given the opportunity to help people 's second chance and to find their place in the society . EOS
SOS because the people , they come together , there are about a hundred degrees of hatred , each of them are full of hope and each of them has a huge potential . EOS
SOS they were able to make lots of great kinds of scenes . EOS
SOS and with that cow , they could really be large and large to germany and for every single one of us . EOS
SOS and i could actually tell a thousand things about what you can do , but because i do n't have any time there , although there 's a minute , and i sent them to one minute . EOS
SOS now you can do your cell phone , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't make code . EOS
SOS take the code , and then they come back to the side of a lot of ways that they can do . EOS
SOS and that would help us all . EOS
SOS i 've been looking for your engagement now , and we 'll see ourselves . EOS
SOS and then you create the code . EOS
SOS i loved it . EOS
SOS many of them do n't have a cell phone . EOS
SOS have you become so hard , or what ? EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS first of all , one of these things came out . EOS
SOS now , i 'm glad that we can connect . EOS
SOS my name is ezra . EOS
SOS my motto is always easier to talk about . EOS
SOS i 'm going to come out of this room , this is in venice . EOS
SOS i 'm very pleased to be very beautiful here . EOS
SOS i 'm going to give you a very clear time here . EOS
SOS and that 's not a joke . that 's a feeling . EOS
SOS yes , yes , unlike the other i 'm not here today , i 'm not here today . EOS
SOS i did n't know what . EOS
SOS but it is so that i write my message in my play , and this then , i think , mostly in time or other , or just like that today . EOS
SOS yes , and i was also asked to ask you a couple of text texts to make a little bit of this . EOS
SOS and that 's exactly what i 'm doing now . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS i start with a joke . EOS
SOS they meet two chickens . EOS
SOS so let me say that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , two
SOS the other thing . EOS
SOS he did n't want to take a damn look at it . EOS
SOS here we would have a level of scale . EOS
SOS the first text is a small video i 'd written about . EOS
SOS i got it back to a person that i discovered . EOS
SOS it 's called the title . EOS
SOS and yes , they did n't understand it . EOS
SOS as your head in my 20s , my neighbor lost the rest of my ceiling . EOS
SOS my leg was also under my ceiling left outside the ceiling . EOS
SOS my leg was going through the ceiling . EOS
SOS it 's about your head . it 's down to my lap , and the rest of her underneath the ceiling , looking under the ceiling , her leg outside the ceiling . EOS
SOS it 's taken off when my leg became extremely long . EOS
SOS it was very romantic . EOS
SOS the next text i gave back to a person which i think is very much . EOS
SOS and that 's my premise . EOS
SOS we did n't have a close contact . EOS
SOS my beloved surgeon had been a lot of career . EOS
SOS as a child has already close with love . EOS
SOS it 's exactly me , yeah . EOS
SOS yes , dear text . EOS
SOS better than that . EOS
SOS jesus is the only warrior standing on the water on the bus . EOS
SOS but where was jesus when he was supposed to save me in front of this year ? EOS ? EOS
SOS have you think yes ? EOS
SOS have i made my way back ? EOS
SOS close text . EOS
SOS the next text is a little longer . EOS
SOS he takes a long time . EOS
SOS so for writing . EOS
SOS reading goes faster . EOS
SOS is the start of a novel that i 'd call you about one of the speech . EOS
SOS ah , it 's about 7,000 guys , so the smallest ones of a guy who always leaves the hair again and a little bit . EOS
SOS but i 'm still going to push my mind again and again , and again , again , i feel about this position from the back of
SOS because i do n't always know the hair . EOS
SOS chapter one . EOS
SOS if i push my head up my head . EOS
SOS and as empty as the sheet that he tried to fill . EOS
SOS yes , i did n't come . EOS
SOS it 's a lot of hard and a half hours
SOS the next text is also a little bit . EOS . EOS
SOS most people do n't understand . EOS
SOS i do n't like to teach myself . EOS
SOS and that 's what i like to play with my fame and with my speech . EOS
SOS i always love to play . EOS . EOS
SOS and yes , they come out of these things . EOS
SOS it 's called the title . EOS
SOS it 's a little bit strange . EOS
SOS it 's probably the case that i 've ever written . EOS
SOS morton bast EOS . EOS
SOS yes , we can . EOS
SOS let 's all know that . EOS
SOS we 're feeding . EOS
SOS do n't give me a case . EOS
SOS but i can . EOS
SOS i can do it . EOS
SOS i ca n't . EOS
SOS yes , i did n't understand it . EOS
SOS no idea . EOS
SOS yes , yes , i 'm sorry about this . EOS
SOS i always say , either everyone or none . EOS
SOS the next sheet has also what to do with text . EOS
SOS it 's kind of a little bit like a little bit . EOS
SOS i 've written that back to insects . EOS
SOS very sick . EOS
SOS yes , dear text . EOS
SOS it 's a bit smaller . EOS
SOS and that 's cool when i 'm going to say three to you . EOS
SOS my text is the title , all good things are cool . EOS
SOS so basically , what 's happening is that way you can do is
SOS it 's going to be deadly printers . EOS
SOS so you have to have patience , you know , click , you 're going , and then the whole better thing , and that 's it . EOS
SOS nice thing . EOS
SOS yes , even more conservative , that 's another one . EOS
SOS and that 's cool when i make it so that we could all make all the way that we all might be able to do , so we try all the time . EOS
SOS that 's exactly what the wind does . EOS
SOS the text is wearing the title . EOS . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS fun with you . EOS
SOS the video text is just a sentence . EOS
SOS i like to write like this little clip . EOS
SOS this is actually a joint spell . EOS
SOS ev is written with delicious . EOS
SOS sebastian betti EOS
SOS yes , yes . EOS
SOS fun with you . EOS
SOS yes , even more sentence . EOS
SOS it 's written in tunisia . EOS
SOS it 's a very long sentence . EOS
SOS i think it 's almost impossible to explain , to explain , to explain to explain , that 's the point . EOS
SOS here 's another text . EOS
SOS that day is a nightmare . EOS
SOS the title is from the text . EOS
SOS this day is a nightmare , and he knows it . EOS
SOS he already knew it before i was like this . EOS
SOS he was working on me for me , and he took me to let me pass . EOS
SOS i could go later on him . EOS
SOS i made him the pleasure . EOS
SOS it took him as an alien from all other days ago , and i would sleep inside them . EOS
SOS with a lump of grass in the face of the face ? EOS
SOS and intent , no longer , i 'm going to go through . EOS
SOS and if i want to wake up again , i ca n't have that one day . EOS
SOS okay , right ? EOS
SOS now it 's time for a little joke . EOS
SOS what was invented einstein when he did n't write his whistling ? EOS
SOS i cried . EOS
SOS that 's how . EOS
SOS peter hundred sounds sounds like the cow . EOS
SOS that 's funny . EOS
SOS yes , the other text has learned that paper . EOS
SOS it 's more like political . EOS
SOS so i do n't just write crazy stuff . EOS
SOS i 'm also writing very political things . EOS
SOS and that 's what i often asked where i 'm doing . EOS
SOS and yeah , i just wrote that text . EOS
SOS he called the title . EOS
SOS my dad came from zimbabwe , then in my mom and i was in her . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS if we had the brakes . EOS
SOS thank you very much . EOS
SOS yes , i 'm happy to make some advertising . EOS
SOS i ca n't use business or so much , so i have to keep doing that . EOS
SOS and that 's what i 'm doing now even though , and i also also put a decent tigers in denmark . EOS
SOS i want to show you . EOS
SOS and yes , i 'm talking , i 'll actually make you very much . EOS
SOS and yeah . EOS
SOS i just want to say that . EOS
SOS it goes on the program . EOS
SOS more advertising . EOS
SOS that 's a little advertising i wrote about . EOS
SOS feet . EOS
SOS rich in vitamin c . EOS
SOS so the patrollers . EOS
SOS vitamin d . EOS
SOS it 's kind of funny . EOS
SOS i 'd like to write a joke about my girlfriend 's talk , but the light was just flat . EOS
SOS yes , it 's not the last thing . EOS . EOS
SOS if you want to get on the edge of the day today , the next day , two miles ago , you 'd have the same cartoon of all . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS thank you very much . EOS
SOS you were great . EOS
SOS thank you , ladies and gentlemen . EOS
SOS let me begin with a quick question . EOS
SOS why would you run more ? EOS ? EOS
SOS i think anybody who should be used to be wondering whether he can give away any given of the society . EOS
SOS the answer is very clear . EOS
SOS we now know that the life expectancy at the time is only at the point of time , about 85 percent growth . EOS
SOS it has to be any kind of , the impact of the influence on the horizon . EOS
SOS why do we still know that ? EOS
SOS why are we going to take a lot of from this messages from where you are looking for part of each other ? EOS
SOS you remember all of you found 30 years ago . EOS
SOS it was fat . EOS
SOS you thought when you go out fat out of food , we 're all going to get fat and get healthy . EOS
SOS so , what happens to the end of the world 's product is given at various variables in american settings , and what has nothing to do that the americans has grown every year . EOS
SOS then they said , ah , no . EOS
SOS but not the fat . EOS
SOS it 's the sum . EOS
SOS and then , as far as the sales of the cup of the cup of the video industry , the family and so forth . EOS
SOS so there 's always going to move again and over again new grains of water through the ground . EOS
SOS now , how all of this do ? EOS
SOS now the reason is , to my taste , to me is that we 've been doing with our neural approach to scientific ideas . EOS
SOS so , in the case , for example , example , there 's a person in
SOS you know , you know , you know , you know ,
SOS now , back a year , a lot of a sudden magazine had a new caledonian . EOS
SOS the top five times of the driving drive for the next year . EOS
SOS keith attenborough was seven years of his life on place . EOS
SOS then she died the newspaper . EOS
SOS or this lady here . EOS
SOS morton bast . EOS
SOS the oldest man on earth ever lived on earth . EOS
SOS thirty years old . EOS
SOS i know there are somewhere people who say they are six , but they just ca n't find their hands . EOS
SOS mcdonald 's actually become a child 's life . EOS
SOS and she stopped with them too , but with them over to smoke , and then finally , he began to follow up with the path at the path side to follow and stop . EOS
SOS you have it died . EOS
SOS so what does this tell us ? EOS
SOS it 's not that liberals are healthy healthy . EOS
SOS but it tells us that we 're very complicated about we need to get through statistics , we need basic and we have to ask questions . EOS
SOS in addition to the very simple question , and a very simple thing that 's in many countries , women are older than men . EOS
SOS what is this ? EOS
SOS we know it now . EOS
SOS so , that 's basically alive to what 's going on in the male industry . EOS
SOS and there are very simple evidence for that , because of men get exactly as old as women . EOS
SOS now , can anyone imagine whether that 's a sale sale . EOS
SOS solly is a country country . EOS
SOS but there are even better barriers , not fear . EOS
SOS in general , we 're going to start to fix ourselves out how to fix us . EOS
SOS sounds complicated , but it 's easy to tell you about anything . EOS
SOS so here 's a guy running up to someone who woke up , and asks , what did they do for a different way that they get so old ? EOS
SOS ah . EOS
SOS the iranians gave up every day . EOS
SOS that 's probably the secret of your age , right ? EOS
SOS in the same time , the ten commandments may not be cut . EOS
SOS or , but they 've grown up and turkey would n't be older . EOS
SOS even hard statistics are n't always static . EOS
SOS for example , for example , there are very heavy statistics that shows that people who are older are older than people who do n't do that . EOS
SOS gisela . EOS
SOS you know . EOS
SOS is that what 's going on ? EOS
SOS no . EOS
SOS it 's because people just have enough money in their pocket about their age of age their age and the vulnerable conditions . EOS
SOS but if i 'm going to give you a group of physicists on the food , and this group has been alive by 20 percent longer now than a hundred years ago that you did n't have a look at the surface , but otherwise , i actually thought a lot of EOS EOS
SOS and in fact , these are attempts made . EOS
SOS i have to tell you , but you know , you know , you know , you know , `` you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
SOS and that works for all these organisms . EOS
SOS for example of bacteria . EOS
SOS you can see there 's all sorts of bacteria . EOS
SOS if we look at the distance , the horizontal line , the longer shows of life . EOS
SOS and the same is true of the food produced , for example , and recently , only about two years ago in the united states that it even does for monkeys . EOS
SOS it 's not about being thin . EOS
SOS it also works in working on the street kitchen . EOS
SOS and that 's another experiment , which is made in the united states . EOS
SOS what did you do here ? EOS
SOS you 've taken out to the past , and you 've got a level of life , you know , a diet of diet where so many of them came here and night . EOS
SOS and who cares it , the trees have been thick , sick , and they 've done a lot of terrible life , and bad people . EOS
SOS now , you 've taken around a hundred and that 's exactly the same amount of information , and it has exactly the same amount of money only that i was running before . EOS
SOS they have nothing to eat in the past , they have twice twice as much . EOS
SOS and that statistic has been both and healthy and healthy , and it does n't have any basis . EOS
SOS even though they were producing into the stores , though they were sold
SOS they both have a lot of potatoes . EOS
SOS a sick and the other healthy . EOS . EOS
SOS so what happens there ? EOS
SOS it 's going to be a process called the ice tube or the rains . EOS
SOS whenever they 're living organisms , or cells , then the organism , the organism , the organism in the cell , or in order to turn down the energy in order to make it back . EOS
SOS that makes sense . EOS
SOS and that looks like this . EOS
SOS you can see , as in the cell itself , they 're mainly as mainly as mainly , which is during the older age . EOS
SOS and then the owner of that , with the training , is going to sequence and turn the cell as energy . EOS
SOS now this is going to happen as well as it would happen in the old mountains . EOS
SOS that 's exactly the actual extension of the colony , or the human rights often often . EOS
SOS so , in order to break it in various organisms . EOS
SOS and it 's probably probably that that 's true for people . EOS
SOS and we learn that they do n't just like to put in the video of each other at the day at the day . EOS
SOS no . EOS
SOS but you should say if you have hungry , you know , maybe you 're going to keep on your webcam . EOS
SOS you want your hunger as a friend . EOS
SOS and that makes sense of other ways . EOS
SOS in the process of nine , nine nine percent of human human human history has happened if he failed ? EOS
SOS right , it has gone . EOS
SOS we 're going to go through the microscope when we hungry . EOS
SOS and that 's safe to biology . EOS
SOS now we , of course , and that 's already in the bible , in 2100 , the spirit is local , but the meat is weak . EOS
SOS it looks very different for us . EOS
SOS now here , there 's been shown in tel labs at a baseball bar . EOS
SOS the three mate here are good food eating the food , let 's have it . EOS
SOS and that 's sort of the end of the way . EOS
SOS so we went out to the search for what the molecular response of the means itself is the organism . EOS
SOS this could be interesting for people , not enough that are n't going to give you very quickly . EOS
SOS and it might tell us about one of the hard aspects of life . EOS
SOS so the question is , we can take the squares , the somali , the most vulnerable , even though you eat ? EOS
SOS and we have a lot of a hundred , a thousand , a lot of the world . EOS
SOS we found an found in fact that 's called the case . EOS
SOS in fact , what 's happening in all organisms , which is , in all organisms , but also , in all organisms , as much organisms . EOS
SOS in the skin it 's on it . EOS
SOS so , by the way , people have a little bit of turning on the skin as a result . EOS
SOS and if we 're going to put on the human cells , for example , you see this . EOS
SOS that 's a total hybrid cell here . EOS
SOS it 's the terminator , and we 're seeing a lot of a thousand of those little kids in the cell , which is during the age of life . EOS
SOS now , if you look like this would look like this . EOS
SOS and that works in various organisms . EOS
SOS so here 's an example , for example . EOS
SOS and so we 've been able to find out what the midden industry is going on in the order . EOS
SOS life because the organisms are the longer ones . EOS
SOS and the answer is , again , you 're going to see here at the typical typical day here . EOS
SOS they 're simple qualified . EOS
SOS after all day , all of the dead are dead , after days , about half the dead . EOS
SOS when we 're going to put on the drinking water , here 's where animals are getting older and survive . EOS
SOS we also know that human cells , we 've been at from darwinian nuclear history in culture , about three times as long as we put them together . EOS
SOS and then finally , the latest research is also the moment that even though life comes from all over mice . EOS
SOS and it 's not just the life ; it 's also the lift . EOS
SOS these micro-machines are very repetitive . EOS
SOS so . EOS
SOS now , all of you want all of you , where does it go from ? EOS
SOS as the name said , it 's been discovered in the courtyard , there it comes out there . EOS
SOS but i can skip it in japan , also , in the same district district , and a product of the adult kingdom , which is in japan , which happens to be large , which is so popular a lot . EOS
SOS we 've told ourselves that if we 're working on the surface of this , by using the standard , then it might work against death ? EOS
SOS you 've got to know that the common implication of all the indigenous diseases is that it 's during the living brain . EOS
SOS and we did experiments in doing experiments . EOS
SOS you 'll be wondering , we 've done it in flies . EOS
SOS tumor treating fields are also going to be able to figure out when they get older . EOS
SOS they have more in the brain when they 're old . EOS
SOS and the molecular mechanisms which are quite similar to people . EOS . EOS
SOS now you ask yourself , how to the devil has looked at the memory of frequency ? EOS
SOS this is the experiment we made in common with books that we did . EOS
SOS you take a hundred cell flies , and you can put in a sample of one of the brain they love . EOS
SOS morton bast EOS
SOS and let me go back to that one . EOS
SOS and then you take the same fly , you put them into the next layer and you give them apart to others that they love , which is . EOS
SOS we let them enjoy it while they 're going to get rid of it . EOS
SOS gisela giardino . EOS
SOS and then they 're going to fly the same fly in again . EOS this . EOS
SOS the driving down to the front down there . EOS . EOS
SOS and if you get down there , there 's a side of a page and another page . EOS
SOS where do they go ? EOS
SOS yeah . EOS
SOS it 's a habit . EOS
SOS except that one . EOS
SOS these are the constellations . EOS
SOS or , let 's say you have character . EOS
SOS i love my siblings , and i do n't let it go through so long . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS but as far as the character of the character that happens with older . EOS
SOS not only . EOS
SOS and we could actually bring the squares of the fly through a flying line , on a scale . EOS
SOS and the organizers of the brain came back in the brain . EOS
SOS that means that it 's not just about aging , but it 's also against marine diseases . EOS . EOS
SOS and that 's important , because we do n't want to give away the emissions in the workforce . EOS
SOS it makes no sense to give away the time . EOS
SOS and i do n't want to leave you without even a couple of practical tips that we 're going to stay younger . EOS
SOS even more quickly . EOS
SOS it 's not about giving weight or something like that . EOS
SOS there are , by the way , there are thousands of thousands of people who eat a day , and one day nothing . EOS
SOS this is the equivalent of a plate under the outside of the shell and the colombian lanes . EOS
SOS and they think that 's very well . EOS
SOS that is , it 's cluttered . EOS
SOS keep them off . EOS
SOS it 's not even dangerous . EOS
SOS it 's really about candy . EOS
SOS now , you know , your obsession is obese to kill diabetes , even when you 're exposed . EOS
SOS and you know that sugar can grow the growth of tumors . EOS
SOS this is where you 're going to see in the future coming out of time . EOS
SOS after 30 days they 're all dead . EOS
SOS it 's going to decrease from the very small samples of the hospital . EOS
SOS to create a very different effect . EOS
SOS there 's only one example of this happening in almost all of the organisms . EOS
SOS they eat faster and vegetables . EOS
SOS it turns out that the gift of too much better and from the end of it . EOS
SOS you can know that all of you can do -- you know , can get cancer , EOS cancer . EOS
SOS that 's not under circumstances for vitamin d . EOS
SOS we are probably here in the winter of winter , because vitamin d is being replaced by sunlight on the skin . EOS
SOS some of them are at least three times a week . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS instead of the time , they give a certain point of 10 and 10 years of life . EOS
SOS do you keep yourself in time with this , the silence . EOS
SOS the impact of literacy and blood pressure is on the life . EOS . EOS
SOS because they are almost as long as women . EOS
SOS in fact , as long as children , life is longer than children . EOS
SOS life is longer than death . EOS
SOS but more than that 's still longer than death . EOS
SOS only death used to die . EOS
SOS what is this ? EOS
SOS people think that 's what they 're doing to do . EOS . EOS
SOS no way , that 's very simple . EOS
SOS now , if you look at the window here , the window is in the window , then i 'm going to take the back to the side with this .
SOS and what 's probably happening is in their backyard . EOS . EOS
SOS in fact , in other words , as you know , you 're going to be done by alcohol under the circumstances . EOS
SOS and that 's why , of course , alcohol works the same way . EOS
SOS a lot of partners or family family is associated with parkinson 's . EOS
SOS they should n't live in a much walkable street . EOS
SOS now you 're going to think about it now . EOS
SOS but that has nothing to do with nothing . EOS
SOS it 's about comfort . EOS
SOS you can have the closer at the level of a much longer street , which has more control of it . EOS
SOS and that 's when he says i was getting used to it . EOS
SOS i can do well well and i can sleep well , and i can sleep in it . EOS . EOS
SOS right . EOS
SOS it 's even more death than the blood and that 's bad . EOS
SOS now , sunlight is going to be resolved because of course . EOS
SOS we now know that there may be a very good economic effects . EOS
SOS most importantly , it can lower the savings . EOS
SOS and we also know that in fact , to protect the informal and the oppressed , they protect us against disasters .
SOS and we knew that by the way , we 've also been working on our tracks , and so on . EOS
SOS not without any sense . EOS
SOS several studies have shown that dark chocolate can be used against hiv/aids . EOS
SOS just recently , a recent study of work that has shown that $ half half the board is only five times a day at the level of a button . EOS
SOS you know , the same thing you 've been looking at is that the scene of coffee . EOS
SOS there are studies of studies that are showing there , there are studies which are not . EOS
SOS which is clear , is that coffee versus diabetes is going to act on diabetes , and it makes her legal performance better . EOS
SOS and coffee is also a good end of the process , because it suggests how we could show together with flying flying in paris . EOS
SOS in fact , in addition to people in the hundreds of thousands of thousands of years , showed people in the hundreds of thousands of years have shown that people who were eating each other day every day every day every day every day every day of eating their revenue by 20 percent . EOS
SOS this is a tremendous value for what we did . EOS
SOS and that 's true for freespeech , desires , novels , flop , ack , travel . EOS
SOS but not yet , for the census of the flu , they 're actually not there . EOS
SOS they just give them up by saying , okay ? EOS
SOS but that 's actually quite possible . EOS
SOS so you do n't think about this . EOS
SOS the next point is a little bit freaky . EOS
SOS now , if you 're going to avoid the slide from a much more animal protein , so by meat and glue , but only if you 're living between age and years old . EOS
SOS in fact , this really interesting new study shows that if you 're using a lot of bacterial proteins , you 're going to take your very efficient increase as if you were a strong . EOS
SOS that 's not the time after the time after the animal of proteins are good , and it 's not true for kids , or teenagers , the animal proteins need , and they 're not doing for pregnant and those who want it . EOS
SOS in general , they 're attracted to . EOS
SOS whatever they do , they 've been hearing about this thing , which is told , of course , the promise , the horror , the more vulnerable , the head of health . EOS
SOS all of this is going to hear about antarctica . EOS
SOS this is the gentleman from the gentleman , because he lived after that regime , and he has been sold years old . EOS
SOS it comes out of my home from the back of my home . EOS
SOS and it goes very well . EOS
SOS he 's not like a psychologist or he lives in a van where there are lots of very healthy people . EOS
SOS he took about the show i told you about this . EOS
SOS we should do very , in all of all , in all of the very many experiments that we do n't see . EOS
SOS and that is , in fact , that the gene of the design does n't become a biological biological system , and it seems to be a social engineering , and then finally , you end up with a
SOS you give the old people less and that could be one of the most dramatic mistakes of our culture . EOS
SOS and by the end , the biggest novel of the year was a year ago . EOS
SOS the brothers mate . EOS
SOS a piece of work , in the most expensive artist , is the stolen brand . EOS
SOS thank you for your attention . EOS
SOS i want to start with a question i think . EOS . EOS
SOS one question , where now nobody got up , because that 's a little bit of a little bit of the who of them ? EOS
SOS it 's very low . EOS
SOS less than i thought . EOS
SOS but there 's probably some reasons why they did not meet it , and the people who would love it would be true to themselves . EOS
SOS a lot of people are fixed and talents , and now think of that . EOS
SOS that 's not the case . EOS
SOS now you 're going to see innovation being a phenomenon of people as alone . EOS
SOS it may also be because they did n't get up because the question is sweet . EOS
SOS do you feel crazy or you 're mad ? EOS
SOS you can feel more comfortable without having been wet . EOS
SOS and you can feel more lonely without having it . EOS
SOS there 's also a lot of shame with shame . EOS
SOS now , again , there 's going to be some right now here at tedwomen . EOS
SOS dna causes rise into shame and error in harmony . EOS
SOS heart takes time . EOS
SOS again , nobody here will have shown in the few seconds that i gave you . EOS
SOS heart needs it . EOS
SOS it takes time to be aware of its time . EOS
SOS and needless to also need a way to talk about it . EOS
SOS and we do n't own that practice . EOS
SOS we do n't have the language yet we have signs of ourselves for ourselves when we are overwhelmed ? EOS
SOS there are two things i 've been over again . EOS
SOS one of the humanity says , you know , is from the beginning of noise . EOS
SOS from birth to death , you 're actually just lying . EOS
SOS there are few moments in your life where you can do that . EOS
SOS and these people are often going to push down often , and they move the whole day . EOS
SOS i do n't have time to her . EOS . EOS
SOS and then there are people in humans that say , everything is connected to everything . EOS
SOS i do n't really know that i 'm just part of the big universe . EOS
SOS and there 's the great group that i do for as well . EOS
SOS you think , okay , today i 'm in the next day , and the next day , well it 's all together . EOS
SOS when we think about ourselves , first of all , the great one of them is one . EOS
SOS the liberation of capitalism , the somali of justice capitalism in intensive care . EOS
SOS but about this line , i 'm not going to talk about this tall , which i 'm not going to talk about today , but i want to talk about the little bit about the everyday stages of a theater . EOS us in a theater . EOS
SOS i do n't want to talk about the burden and the end of the car . EOS
SOS now , in addition to other people , we ca n't find very difficult to focus on it . EOS
SOS now , the photographer photographer shows a few photos i 'd like to show you . EOS
SOS it 's easy to keep us in other contexts . EOS
SOS and we do n't know if these people really have felt that moment . EOS
SOS but , you know , if you do n't know about the moment at work , because you think everybody 's talking to each other , you only lose something lost in the corner , and nobody lost to it . EOS
SOS i mean , i think that all of these sudden , of course , of course
SOS maybe some of them have happened today . EOS
SOS and what you do is that what you 're doing about that cell phone is very often , even that you could look at the very well now , is actually the exact thing that 's going on in a cell phone as well as a result . EOS
SOS clearly , if you look at that screen . EOS
SOS what we 're not doing here . EOS
SOS yes , and then there 's the unknowns coming in front of you , and you 're sitting at the edge of a cauliflower at a limb at random square , and you even get something out of the hope you ca n't forget your text . EOS
SOS these are the recipes you see from the outside . EOS
SOS we give other people out . EOS
SOS but i 'm sure there are people in the room who are born from birth to that their whole lives by trying to have their entire life by trying to get rid of this breath of themselves , EOS
SOS and there are also people in this room also , because they need to control people in a different person , it must be because of death or for death . EOS . EOS
SOS there 's nothing else that many people are connected to them ; they 're feeling lonely . EOS
SOS and there are people who have changed the mental self , and they 're so lonely . EOS
SOS i put that in this digital theory . EOS
SOS and you can sit on your seat . EOS
SOS we 're very familiar with us . EOS
SOS these are people in their opinion , they believe . EOS
SOS it 's always relatively . EOS
SOS there is no clan number , not any number when someone has less of human beings , not . EOS
SOS so we immediately immediately get old people . EOS
SOS it 's the design form of trustworthiness . EOS
SOS since then , we 've connected all in living living with lots of people at facebook or six or facebook , that digital has become bigger . EOS
SOS you can be connected to hundreds of people without being connected to a single person . EOS
SOS if it 's in the liberal condition , the number of human relationships that is missing is the quality of relationships . EOS
SOS the two forms of dna are very often sold against each other . EOS
SOS and that 's also because of a sudden , in the bible of gravity is a little bit of crap . EOS
SOS whereas the digital divide are very diverse for the cause and the rains . EOS
SOS it turns out that the digital progression of the future is even more likely to connect when the opportunities are getting bigger . EOS
SOS i do n't know if you 're in 20 years of this sense that will be very similar to the way that we 're going to be very similar , nor will call it . EOS
SOS or whether you find a new model . EOS
SOS but these are also the problems of the generation generation . EOS
SOS nearly even greater than the novelty itself is fear and from this fear of man 's fear to help people . EOS
SOS in fact , the great one , the large one , a man , has written a wonderful written on it . EOS
SOS in that sense of what people do everything to be not alone . EOS
SOS they build , they build , they attract kids , who are then abandoned and alone . EOS
SOS but you do n't leave you to get rid of the cursor before that 's money . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS things . EOS
SOS and the process of the process of the process is that it 's at least a little bit short than the objects you have . EOS
SOS the problem is only that it is very short and it 's going to take this off against television . EOS
SOS that 's why we still need to buy new things . EOS
SOS i 've been looking at the advertising for a flying pad . EOS
SOS and the camera is quite different from cell communication with the model of what they 're doing with . EOS
SOS what do you do in your business does n't know , but apparently also works . EOS
SOS so now there 's nothing to do with the absence of disease among people . EOS
SOS now , alisa 's talk has written a wonderful poem , and there is a side about the worst one , but the worst one is going to get out to the corner . EOS
SOS hand to heart heart , who does n't know that ? EOS
SOS in a relationship or a relationship or to look at the other at the time , and suddenly you feel terrible and feel terrible and asked the question , who is this person ? EOS
SOS so i 'm going to do with anything ? EOS
SOS one study is saying that the women who have been around the world , married , with kids . EOS
SOS it 's missing because i do n't even know whether i 've invented a study of self so often . EOS
SOS but if you do n't even know about research , because at least , it 's not at all , and the reaction is always equal to me . EOS
SOS now the very good thing that 's about to do is that the very good reason is very obvious , it 's
SOS in addition to far is everyone 's lovely , and yet we 're not talking about it . EOS
SOS i 'm going to talk so much about the tv sex . EOS
SOS again , i 've probably experienced everybody . EOS
SOS when you think of it all more time , what do i do here ? EOS
SOS who is that person in my bed ? EOS
SOS again , that 's not necessarily a form of representation that has n't necessarily necessarily what to do with the quality of the resistance . EOS
SOS nothing nothing to do with the quality of relationship . EOS
SOS it 's just always there . EOS
SOS we 're not talking about them because we do n't watch them . EOS
SOS we 're not talking about them in the workforce . EOS
SOS in the business condition , we 're also considered as we think . EOS
SOS i stood up in front of this day , and i watched a group of five of five of them , i 'd better have said , three pieces of hair , and they put it together . EOS
SOS the two men have a conversation that both women have in the workforce . EOS
SOS and in between it was a little bit different , something that 's going on with the lift in the hand . EOS . EOS
SOS i mean , i do n't have to keep you with that scene because it does n't even end up that form of dna that everybody has seen in its own lives . EOS
SOS it 's the vastness of the iceberg . EOS
SOS but it 's also the vastness of the iceberg . EOS
SOS we 're all familiar with the flu or i see , in fact , here are some people who are holding their lives on the other side . EOS
SOS in malawi , in the hotels , in italy , they often do n't know where they are , what they do . EOS
SOS where they are where they wake up . EOS
SOS again , that 's a form of representation that is not about . EOS
SOS just as it is , it is also how can be used as an intentional player . EOS
SOS finland is shown here . EOS
SOS i told him a saying that he called a phone call he was a customer , and he said , `` what happens very , you ca n't imagine . EOS
SOS one of them was in the lunchroom . EOS
SOS so he brought himself to the breath . EOS
SOS and two months later , he 'll be able to tap out . EOS
SOS it 's never going to come up with us . EOS
SOS it comes in connecting with other feelings . EOS
SOS she has beautiful friends , and she 's got very strange moments . EOS
SOS we all know the normal death . EOS
SOS fear , my desperation anger and the shame . EOS
SOS but we should not forget the nice ones . EOS
SOS the freedom of honor the desire to protect it . EOS
SOS that 's why i want to look at the heart theory . EOS
SOS come out of life like the proton and the oppressed . EOS
SOS let them do it and do n't take them . EOS
SOS because there is a much worse than the novelty station , and that 's the empty , which is , if you do n't really feel anything more than you do n't feel anything . EOS
SOS harmony is part of life . EOS
SOS so since i 've been so passionate about this research for two things . EOS things have changed for me . EOS
SOS one in my book , i no longer more than i discovered that i 'm only holding somebody else , why he did n't even raise my mind , because i thought i 'm afraid i 'm afraid of the people , EOS
SOS i 've been able to do it since since i 've been studying the history of my life and let it go . EOS
SOS that 's exactly what it 's like to do with the handle you do . EOS
SOS again , i have become free . EOS
SOS people come up and walk , not immediately immediately , whether they could build a friendship or anything like that . EOS
SOS as a child , i found my parents incredibly embarrassing . EOS
SOS they ca n't stand on any palm without having a conversation . EOS
SOS whether it 's in the business or the economy . EOS
SOS every time it took it . EOS
SOS as a child , i found that as i said . EOS
SOS as a young adult , i 've been incredibly excited to make you that openness . EOS
SOS but just since i 've gone up to myself , i 've been so connected to biology , which is it in my way , and i would love myself to open up . EOS
SOS you can see that 's going to make you feel the next thing to the next . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS yeah , thank you very much . EOS
SOS i 've done three great papers here . EOS
SOS one of them is a sales and a bathing . EOS . EOS
SOS and now i 'm going to ask you , if you 've only got access , what would you take ? EOS
SOS most of them would decide for the recovery . EOS
SOS and that 's a pretty good idea . EOS
SOS and why ? EOS
SOS because we can make the problem the biggest effect . EOS
SOS in health , we 're sort of making that differently . EOS
SOS so we 've got the capacity of the biggest effect , except eight , and choose to other strategies . EOS
SOS we 're going to give you the example of the board and that 's for sports . EOS
SOS big but big effort . EOS
SOS i 'm not going to be so valuable . EOS
SOS or we 're going to choose to the conclusion . EOS
SOS it 's for diet . EOS
SOS but also , very large , very large very much effort . EOS
SOS so i 'm not going to be that valuable . EOS
SOS and i want to talk to you today today to tell you how to make the biggest use . EOS
SOS if you deal with prevention and health , you do n't have to look around a topic . EOS
SOS and the issue is happening . EOS
SOS and the theme of life happened in germany , in germany , there was no issue about it . EOS
SOS and then the number of deaths in germany are strong . EOS
SOS and i asked myself , what was going on going on ? EOS ? EOS
SOS so why did this all of a sudden ? EOS
SOS and then i did research , and i 've also gotten it . EOS
SOS because it was exactly in the years . EOS
SOS what was there ? EOS
SOS so here came to germany . EOS
SOS and we are always going to get bigger ? EOS
SOS and i kept on . EOS
SOS so liberals goes home to germany . EOS
SOS and the trend goes up . EOS
SOS and in the years it takes the curve for years to travel . EOS
SOS and then what comes after germany ? EOS
SOS it 's shaking , and it 's shaking and climbing and forth , and how that all means . EOS
SOS and we are always going to get bigger ? EOS
SOS well , then i got one and one . EOS . EOS
SOS because it was clear . EOS
SOS sports is dick . EOS
SOS and of course , i 'm not here to tell you that sports is thick . EOS
SOS because that 's not true . EOS
SOS but one thing we 've seen in common . EOS
SOS the vast threats of new and new practices -- and by the way , they do n't have to build a healthier choice and healthier . EOS
SOS so what is it then ? EOS
SOS the diet diet ? EOS
SOS and again , there 's a very great study of the states . EOS
SOS it 's also the problem with conservation . EOS
SOS and they 've introduced it in the 1960s . EOS
SOS and then they wanted to see what 's going on ? EOS
SOS and you 've seen that people are actually taking less fat , but people still eat less calories still still . EOS . EOS
SOS and that was henry . EOS
SOS and that 's why they called it . EOS
SOS we can explain this ? EOS
SOS you can imagine the body as a power . EOS
SOS so we 've got so far big here . EOS
SOS and on the one hand , there 's a plate , because we put it on all the street here , which are going down here . EOS
SOS and here 's the energy running as electricity . EOS
SOS now , if we put more in there , however , we put more in our power than we 're using the other side , the energy in power and makes it . EOS
SOS the human body does n't matter the same . EOS
SOS it can store the energy . EOS
SOS it 's in the form of fat . EOS
SOS it 's our greatest and our drive . EOS
SOS but what happens when we heard less like we 've heard , the energy and yet , the energy just gives it to a conclusion . EOS
SOS it 's expanding dramatically . EOS
SOS there is no longer happening at all . EOS
SOS we are only running mobile . EOS
SOS and that 's exactly what happened . EOS
SOS our grandparents are gone down a mile at foot . EOS
SOS and we are now going to go to a few miles , and these are the positive estimate . EOS
SOS there are studies at the point of five -- until by 2050 . EOS
SOS i 'll tell you a little bit more closely with my friend . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS do you give me the chair ? EOS
SOS mike , do you have heard ? EOS
SOS mike is an american . EOS
SOS he 's shy , he 's not going to talk a lot . EOS
SOS and he was back in that trial , and he 's sitting here . EOS
SOS he 's this typical grail , he 's held down a course , and he has a seat in the hand . EOS
SOS and mike still eat less and less and less , and yet it 's getting and bigger . EOS
SOS why ? EOS
SOS because archie is only sitting . EOS
SOS and i watched a lot of movement called the afternoon , and i took him so much back in the pocket , and i went back to it . EOS
SOS and there was a thousand steps . EOS
SOS so this was the distance , the british union , came from the car with the car in the office , of course , a little bit of coffee , and evening again . EOS
SOS and he came to a thousand steps . EOS
SOS that means mike was about 10 minutes on his legs . EOS
SOS take hours of hours of hours , and years ago , mike or egypt . EOS
SOS under this condition in the conditions . EOS
SOS and mike is not going to be dick , because it does n't eat too much because it 's too long but it 's too long time , but it 's not using energy , but it 's not going to change it , and that energy is going to EOS
SOS and first of all , the energy you 're seeing here at your desk . EOS
SOS but energy is not there . EOS
SOS they are coming back in their blood . EOS
SOS and again , they 're very active and aggressive silent and quiet . EOS . EOS
SOS and so the blood vessels . EOS
SOS so as the energy go into the blood , then the doctors are eaten by the males and high . EOS
SOS and that whale cells , as you can see , is there 's all little holes in this way . EOS
SOS and happiness is still taking the whole fat around , and now this is what 's going to now go through these little wounds , and we 're talking about opec or rhythms . EOS
SOS and now he 's got to get rid of the heart 's right under pressure , because now he has to pump the blood through these steel , and we 're talking out of eggs . EOS
SOS and as if that bottle hits the one , it makes it well . EOS
SOS and if that happens to heart , we call the heart attack . EOS
SOS and if that 's in mind , we call that . EOS
SOS and even in germany , everyone has a second state of heart disease , EOS
SOS that means that in germany , every second day . EOS
SOS so again , it wo n't be sick because it ca n't make a sports , because it does n't move at all . EOS
SOS and if you do n't know that , you always do always in the wrong place . EOS
SOS for example , diet . EOS
SOS i heard more than a thousand ago ago , and that 's where you get rid of the same side of the day . EOS
SOS and if each book is only one thing , and we would put this up here , we would have a $ 50 feet of a high chromosome to grow on . EOS
SOS and i 've read that for all . EOS
SOS and there it goes in there , and that 's really important when you add more energy than you 're going to use it . EOS
SOS and if you 're going less energy than you 're using them , you 're going to use it . EOS
SOS that 's brilliant . EOS
SOS but why do we need to share things out ? EOS
SOS that just gives you an end . EOS
SOS the need of course is vast , of course , is not help . EOS
SOS because why does a diet need a hundred percent ? EOS
SOS because it 's a diet , it 's not a lifestyle . EOS
SOS so , what are the solutions that we 're doing for three weeks here , and here for five weeks here , if we went up to this battle , to our normal lives . EOS
SOS so what do you think of five or seven weeks ? EOS
SOS nothing . EOS
SOS except , again , again , there 's a fantasy that we did n't have done what we 've done . EOS
SOS so you 're allowed to talk about each new diet , in every new way , and you want to ask it in your daily life . EOS
SOS yes or no ? EOS
SOS and then if it happens . EOS
SOS and if you do n't leave it . EOS
SOS because when you get nothing out there , it 's pure time . EOS
SOS these are the decisions that we decide about whether we get sick or healthy . EOS
SOS these are the bad habits that make us sick . EOS
SOS and it 's the good habits that make us healthy . EOS
SOS and when you look in the mirror , he sees the result of the everyday . EOS
SOS when mike look into the mirror , he 's seeing his daily habits . EOS
SOS and when rocks look into the mirror and be honest , he also looks where he 's gone . EOS
SOS because if he had more bad habits than good , it 's a place left . EOS
SOS and as designers get into the direction of their goals , then he does n't necessarily have to change his whole life . EOS
SOS then he just takes more good habits than bad . EOS
SOS and a trained biologist mike is also a great example of the fact that the man has already a strange animal . EOS
SOS mike made it for an example of his everyday time by using each other way using the car using using using using energy , using it every mosquito . EOS
SOS and in the evening , he sits at the top of the walk , and it has to come back to movement . EOS
SOS so he put up in his pockets as well as well as he said yes , and then there will be like so many times a little bit like that , so it sort of comes back to motion . EOS
SOS and my grandpa had just as mysterious as she did . EOS
SOS he was a farmer , and he did n't understand that . EOS
SOS i would have said , `` you know , '' is not moving for people . EOS
SOS and in fact , it 's right . EOS
SOS why do we have to deal with night in our local years of time on the end of the day ? EOS
SOS and what we need to do is to take two hours per day today . EOS
SOS but that 's much easier to find the movement again where we lost them . EOS
SOS in the same day . EOS
SOS and that 's why i want you to do this today . EOS
SOS you may also know the situation , and you go in the evening , and you also know that in the first row there is no place . EOS
SOS and that 's what you see , as we 're finding , is that we 're in charge of these intuitions .
SOS we always want to keep in the tracks . EOS . EOS
SOS we plan to build our homes so that we have the tendency of the way . EOS
SOS we plan to our whole life so that we do n't have the basis , but we do n't get to where we 're going to . EOS
SOS but in a very different direction . EOS
SOS and that 's why you 've got to switch down today and look at the movement and see where it comes out . EOS
SOS i 'd like to leave you like that . EOS
SOS and i 'm the only one and down and down and down and down and down and everybody else . EOS
SOS but if i look at that , i 'm going to get time for myself . EOS
SOS but then i 'm going to skip the movement that is just that way . EOS
SOS and when it comes from the top , 30 minutes ago , says `` i am biased . '' EOS
SOS naíma steps . EOS
SOS that 's about three times 10 minutes ago . EOS
SOS and a recent thinking of taking steps when it comes from today every day today , which means that they were at the end of the day 12 pounds of not in their body . EOS
SOS now this may be pretty quick . EOS
SOS but as an ecologist , as a chemist , we 're talking four pounds of fat . EOS
SOS we do n't have our bodies in our bodies . EOS
SOS and you give me one more time about this ; i 'll always hook you . EOS
SOS so the americans are nuts , which are so nuts . EOS
SOS that 's a $ five pounds of fat . EOS
SOS i mean , if i 'm four pounds . EOS
SOS just with that , you can see what happens with these little games . EOS
SOS and if that 's the effect of this context , which is what they only happens when they really start into an active life . EOS
SOS and this is where they 're coming from a day in their daily lives . EOS
SOS and as soon as you 've got to have 30 steps per day , they 're almost virtually all of the aspects of it . EOS
SOS and then if you look like that and then you go back and then you 're going to put that on top . EOS
SOS and then they went next to the olympics . EOS
SOS then they get faster and stronger . EOS . EOS
SOS but they do n't care their health anymore . EOS
SOS it 's not dependent on your health and your time . EOS
SOS because most important is the most important thing to do right now . EOS
SOS and i used to make a living lifestyle . EOS
SOS and for me , it is more than a lifestyle , to me , to me , it is a very clear decision for life and for myself . EOS
SOS because i believe , health does n't mean what we should do or to do . EOS
SOS but health is what we want to do . EOS
SOS and that 's why i 'm only just an idea for you . EOS
SOS just want you to just look for the best . EOS
SOS and you know how it goes . EOS
SOS step forward . EOS
SOS thank you very much . EOS
SOS so how did there have been a leonardo da vinci that was so incredible and so incredible and the way in the world with other eyes ? EOS
SOS and in fact , even so far to what was happening at his time just simply being realized ? EOS
SOS could we do that today ? EOS
SOS have you like what to do with you ? EOS
SOS and how can we force that and become our future ? EOS
SOS so let 's start with the question , what do we do with innovation ? EOS
SOS yeah . EOS
SOS technology , technology research , and development even has the title of the federal century . EOS
SOS so they get me right . EOS
SOS that 's all great . EOS
SOS and we can be with quite proud of that , and we be grateful that we are going to discuss that we are in fact that our technologies are all over the world will be used to us . EOS
SOS we have an extraordinary unique wealth . EOS
SOS but what about the future ? EOS
SOS what do the challenges come to us ? EOS
SOS and who cares , because there is about the big ecological and social challenges ? EOS
SOS so , it seems to be kind of out of the way . EOS
SOS a kind of a rule . EOS
SOS so the economy is going to take care of the ecological challenges , because the entrepreneurs will work with us to productivity and efficiency efficiency . EOS
SOS and the world better do better than the ones that will find in the nonprofit organizations and the people , and also the opportunity , and then the company also have to do the whole world of course , of course , to avoid the power of power economy . EOS
SOS in particular order to fix . EOS
SOS but who says that we need to look at that ? EOS
SOS how would it be if we went to see the social social and cultural change ? EOS
SOS if technological innovation does mean cultural innovation ? EOS
SOS if economic countries are also social innovations ? EOS
SOS if there were certain people who are involved in the process of doing big and social challenges ? EOS
SOS now , if there 's nothing unknown to all other people in the world , and if there are so much different , true to the environment ? EOS
SOS because what was that ? EOS
SOS both sides are trying to want , but what companies do ? EOS
SOS can this happen ? EOS
SOS ask yourself . EOS
SOS so far we 've always seen that . EOS
SOS fortunately , there 's be a compelling example . EOS
SOS max hundred has been working on his life with its backpack in bangladesh , with its backpack in bangladesh . EOS
SOS and interestingly , too much more often in direct terms of what the government of people did . EOS
SOS and he used to know , as a entrepreneur , probably accepted to get rid of the pad . EOS
SOS i think i 'm going to call you a little bit more about somebody in the opportunity . EOS
SOS and let 's face it , i 'll be able to throw away . EOS
SOS this is a very young guy . EOS
SOS great trained , but also his ideal lives . EOS
SOS and so yes , it 's totally irrelevant . EOS
SOS i like that . EOS
SOS and if you see that , then you get a little bit , we do n't need to worry about our future . EOS
SOS yes , in the same morning , he then started somewhere here where he started to work somewhere at one of our current , EOS
SOS he makes it all very well . EOS
SOS it 's totally totally , and it 's very successful . EOS
SOS and yet something 's happening here . EOS
SOS so he is n't even there that somehow i am ? EOS
SOS that 's what the usda does say . EOS . EOS
SOS and in fact , there are all over . EOS . EOS
SOS and they like that . EOS
SOS and he also liked that . EOS
SOS so the one on the right there , he did the same thing . EOS
SOS so it 's not surprising him , but that 's why he tells him what 's happening . EOS
SOS and since that in the middle of the election three , three people did n't know it . EOS
SOS and so the more time he was surprised when he was in the process as she 'd been personal . EOS
SOS as a storyteller . EOS
SOS and as a neuroscientist , an amazing entrepreneur , he turned out there . EOS
SOS now , the great joy is , so with young people , there 's his experience . EOS
SOS and the two people have found it . EOS
SOS and they 've met each other . EOS
SOS how would it be in one of those conversations from the two times ? EOS
SOS and i listened to him , so it was exactly exactly the same thing . EOS
SOS now , what 's exactly the difference between the children 's doing by the way that we need to do that companies ? EOS
SOS i did n't understand that . EOS
SOS yes , so now we 're going to start asking at the question , but in question , what is behavioral finance ? EOS
SOS so i name it already . EOS
SOS renewable markets , growing products , highly customers , fluorescent structures , there 's a limit . EOS
SOS and you can also get quite a single idea of where the whole shapes . EOS
SOS and even in the end of the same day , even though that 's very , it 's true . EOS . EOS
SOS so , what is it going to happen ? EOS
SOS so , you know , you know , well , one thing is , it 's not a small copy of a big company . EOS
SOS it 's something very different . EOS
SOS it has a completely different character . EOS
SOS because it 's not going to have it . EOS
SOS no copyright customer , no longer , no longer , nothing is known . EOS
SOS so , from that point , an extension organization is to seek a model that is to seek out of a business model , of course , of course , but mostly , and then the scale . EOS
SOS and you 're probably going to understand that , of course , there is very different other ways of course , other ways , different ways . EOS
SOS yeah , that 's pretty clear to me . EOS
SOS but what are we looking for ? EOS
SOS so , i mean , i mean , i mean , i mean , you know , i 'll leave you to make a child 's child , right ? EOS
SOS so i 've also got a degree , which is pretty well , so , what do you see in berlin would you like me ? EOS ? EOS
SOS that 's called the case . EOS
SOS as you 've successful your business and raise your life for your life . EOS
SOS oh no . EOS
SOS right ? EOS
SOS what do you think about if you want to go back at the beginning of 30 , what is you going to do ? EOS
SOS so then you 're going to do a career as a hobby , or what ? EOS
SOS what happens with your engagement like i know you ? EOS
SOS and also , we also look at the pace . EOS . EOS
SOS so the statistics on top of you are not going to give you an unfortunate perspective , because you are only a few years ago in a much more years of the situation than before . EOS
SOS money is always the result of a successful company and a good partner company . EOS
SOS well sure , money is a power for social assistance . EOS
SOS and it 's the basis of all economic ecosystems . EOS
SOS but it 's never the end of a company . EOS
SOS yes , what is the objective ? EOS
SOS the company ? EOS
SOS so , if i have a look at what i 've learned , so there is no way of the right thing . EOS
SOS and so , some of the things we need to do , however , is always going to be done , and so on . EOS
SOS and if i did n't have that , so i mean , how can i not know something i 'm going to be ? EOS ? EOS
SOS so this makes me not a good feeling . EOS
SOS so , as i do , because there are no risks to me , and risks , it feels for me to all of that . EOS
SOS yes , welcome welcome to the state business . EOS
SOS but i might say what to you . EOS
SOS one is . EOS
SOS so the one is already on , so it 's almost secret . EOS
SOS successful generation from generation to generation . EOS
SOS one of the things for the brain work . EOS
SOS so , how do you say today ? EOS
SOS so , what do i mean by that ? EOS ? EOS
SOS so we 're always going to tell you . EOS
SOS at interaxon , the international and the sexual mental act . EOS
SOS so helps it . EOS
SOS i mean , i can give you one more . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS yes , thank you , milo . EOS
SOS but there are only questions about it . EOS
SOS and that can be a moment to you about one of the very important economic issues . EOS
SOS can we take the one on the other side of the other , maybe i get better ? EOS
SOS so the first is , what am i here and what do i want to make ? EOS
SOS yes , yeah , that 's what 's going to do about you , bigger than you are ? EOS
SOS what do you do in the world ? EOS
SOS what do people know about when they work with you ? EOS
SOS what are you ready to give ? EOS
SOS what are your cell , but you may also be hungry ? EOS
SOS why is this so important ? EOS ? EOS
SOS because that 's what happens as well as well as well . EOS
SOS and how did we learn that ? EOS
SOS if you 're a ship , you 're not going to build the men together together , work , you know , if you 're a hot device , but you teach it for the high , most sea . EOS
SOS yes , okay . EOS
SOS so then i started asking the next questions . EOS
SOS so what is my schedule ? EOS
SOS so what does that mean ? EOS
SOS ja : yeah , now you can really see your goal . EOS
SOS in detail in detail , but i 'm going to leave you in a minute if you 're talking about what you do n't want to stay on . EOS
SOS do you actually know the story of the pink elephant ? EOS
SOS if i think about it . EOS
SOS right ? EOS
SOS chimborazo . EOS
SOS so , watch me . EOS
SOS do n't give you pink elephants . EOS
SOS okay ? EOS
SOS does it work ? EOS
SOS so do n't have pink elephants . EOS
SOS understood ? EOS
SOS do n't have pink elephants . EOS
SOS you see ? EOS
SOS it 's how we focus on what we do n't want . EOS
SOS so what is the only possibility ? EOS
SOS so that 's what ? EOS
SOS yeah , yeah , that 's what you want . EOS
SOS so you 're going to zoom together , or maybe you 're going to double the electron on the
SOS but it turns out that way . EOS
SOS by the way , what i 'm going to do now to do is , you know ? EOS
SOS i gave up with you . EOS
SOS look at it . EOS
SOS in 1973 , the swiss smith smith . EOS
SOS who ? EOS
SOS at the end of the day , at least at the end of the day , the next day , you end with a flying line .
SOS i 'm going to skip on top of you at a moment that i used to make my face , and that 's where i used to build my life today . EOS
SOS i 'll put the glass into the 1960s . EOS
SOS i mean , what drives your life 's next year , sir . EOS
SOS and i 'm going to talk about what 's going on in the process of this session . EOS
SOS geoffrey chen martin smith smith . EOS
SOS oh , how did you make all kinds of rules like you ? EOS
SOS if you can see , for example , can give you a moment , two miles ago , you can call one example ago , you can have
SOS morton bast EOS
SOS it 's kind of a matter of every day . EOS
SOS the real thing that we 're doing is that we 're going to show up with
SOS and what does it look like ? EOS
SOS is you what ? EOS
SOS does anything changed ? EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS okay and the flower . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS so then we 're looking at a time and we look at the street . EOS
SOS and practice . EOS
SOS in 1973 , the swiss smith smith . EOS
SOS who ? EOS
SOS at the end of the day , at least at the end of the day , the next day , you end with a flying line .
SOS i 'm going to get rid of those of you sitting in front of your car , at the time , and that 's what i 'd like to make you
SOS i 'll put the glass into the 1960s . EOS
SOS i mean , what drives your life 's next year , sir . EOS
SOS and i 'm going to talk about what 's going on in the process of this session . EOS
SOS geoffrey chen martin smith smith . EOS
SOS and so , how do you deal with it ? EOS
SOS so , i know i was also shocked . EOS
SOS i was really shocked . EOS
SOS when i first saw the first time . EOS
SOS i thought it was probably not . EOS
SOS and more than i was walking through the head , i mean , is it that i actually could have all the time over time ? EOS
SOS through my life . EOS
SOS and okay , i do n't get that sense . EOS
SOS in order to prevent the most immediate force there that we need to recognize most of our perception , we have to recognize our ancestry . EOS
SOS but what happens then ? EOS
SOS what was i talking about , and what am i doing ? EOS
SOS and that 's why you can see your perception in your life , there is going to be other important political quality . EOS
SOS well , yes , thank you , we 'll get to the next question . EOS
SOS how could i actually come to my goal ? EOS
SOS so , i think that 's a good question . EOS
SOS i 'm sorry , because every time i do n't want it . EOS
SOS yes , yeah , there 's a good news for you . EOS
SOS it will be easier to think easier than you might have known them . EOS
SOS because if you realize that you realize your body engine , and when you give yourself , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
SOS it 's almost automatically . EOS
SOS you 're not going to be able to do anything different than that , you 're going to get things on you . EOS
SOS that 's when you 're this famous , which you 've got in the morning . EOS
SOS and i 'll ask you the question , and i 'm looking at it at the moment , who you 're going to be able to ask by advice , `` you ask me more '' to get more contact with home . EOS
SOS and you 've also got a big model . EOS
SOS they have a terrific driver for that . EOS
SOS you 're going to see , like that did n't even further anymore , which is going to be in his 20s , in alabama . EOS
SOS to lunch for the famous big table . EOS
SOS and it 's totally different people . EOS
SOS and so scientists , as a result , politicians , novels , engineers , architects , and he has given his job very strong . EOS . EOS
SOS but it 's not in our modern senses where it went , yes , who cares ? EOS
SOS who 's right ? EOS
SOS but in fact , suddenly , suddenly , suddenly , of course , from these various ways , they began to do so on any way that their own . EOS
SOS well , yes , the next question is , what drives next step ? EOS
SOS in fact , in fact there are successful entrepreneurs that are very simple . EOS . EOS
SOS instead of planning big and practice , and so on just the next step . EOS
SOS because what do you want to do in the area of uncertainty ? EOS
SOS but they 're going to lead these very , and they 're going to get out of all . EOS
SOS and if it was n't there , then dan look at each other . EOS
SOS and even if you had the big , otherwise , you do n't know anything , then there 's some other side . EOS
SOS so it is so important that you realize your mind . EOS
SOS that gives you the social security . EOS
SOS and in the rest of us , we 've all learned to work ? EOS
SOS although we did n't know that , and no one has told it ? EOS
SOS you know , you 're working on kids . EOS
SOS so , in that sense of learning , for example , and that 's what you 've been looking for , it 's also fun in a company that 's going on in a bookstore . EOS
SOS and that 's also the case that we do otherwise otherwise makes us very easily . EOS
SOS yes , thanks mister . EOS
SOS so that sounds really great . EOS
SOS but i do n't know , in the company , i think , i think , i think there 's lots of interviews going through there . EOS . EOS
SOS and even here in germany here in germany , there 's always a common mood . EOS
SOS and i think that there must be a chance to worry that this is changing . EOS
SOS okay , my boy , come on . EOS
SOS how do i go down here . EOS
SOS what do you think how many people can do ? EOS
SOS ten ? EOS
SOS 10,000 ? EOS ? EOS
SOS ten million ? EOS
SOS watch this down . EOS
SOS who you see ? EOS
SOS right , that 's exactly . EOS
SOS that 's the one you can really change . EOS
SOS or in order to start with rachel , to start the change you 're looking in in the world . EOS
SOS do you think beautiful words and great models , but how do you work ? EOS
SOS now , we 're still on the happiness of happiness and we 're still on our edge . EOS
SOS help them in all sorts of years of crisis , or when you feel a little bit of something or if you have a flexible transplant , and you all have to do with you . EOS
SOS and if you ask yourself in that situations , what you 're going to do now is , in all of this , you know , what you 're going to do is to feel what you 're going to do with you feel powerful .
SOS now , i want you guys to think about what you feel like you 're about to . EOS
SOS and at the end of the end , i want you , what you 're actually going to do about this crisis , or what 's wrong happens . EOS
SOS so i mean , if it happened , it already has it . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS thank you very much . EOS
SOS and really , do you really think that 's my way in my way ? EOS ? EOS
SOS yeah . EOS
SOS and you can tell you all two things . EOS
SOS first of all , at the expense of their hands , they 're going to determine the product of their brain , and then they 're going to act on
SOS because that determines your perception . EOS
SOS and for the second place in your inner attitude . EOS
SOS because that 's how people teach them differently . EOS
SOS the future is that every time we change our own perception . EOS
SOS are you going to do that ? EOS
SOS yes , i think i already . EOS
SOS thank you name so . EOS
SOS all right . EOS
SOS yes . EOS
SOS what do you think about our mouths ? EOS
SOS nice . EOS
SOS really , huh ? EOS
SOS and so how do we actually do it , because now we 're going to do this talk now ? EOS
SOS is this a new facility ? EOS
SOS i mean , yes . EOS
SOS all right . EOS
SOS in fact , as i 'm seeing the tv field . EOS . EOS
SOS it 's called the ross running effect . EOS
SOS and that 's what really does really . EOS
SOS it 's a bacchanal from the owner of eden . EOS
SOS and no , i mean , new ones , baby phones . EOS
SOS that 's the case . EOS
SOS it just works for a long famous name on the great famous famous . EOS
SOS from robert dawkins on the board of the day of the day , they 're going to beat up or screaming or as they all say .
SOS let 's see just this spirit . EOS
SOS and who knows , maybe we 're going to be the nearest leonardo of our time . EOS
SOS you can see right now , i 'm fired . EOS
SOS now maybe it would be obvious that i was working with kids and their future , because eventually , children are our future . EOS
SOS instead , that 's what i 've been doing most of the time . EOS
SOS i spend a lot of my life in prison . EOS
SOS four years ago , my dad and i went back to the program to fund , i started working . EOS
SOS we 're faced with reed , which is , you know , can either be able to raise your body or find your job easier to you . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS so why am i so concerned about this , which is the people who have failed , have made the great mistake ? EOS
SOS our program is not that easy to understand how programs that care about children . EOS
SOS and i honestly say that the last place of the last place in the universe is that i would work . EOS
SOS what do you think is the most important factor of the childhood of the people who we work with ? EOS
SOS we 've figured out that there are a positive role of times male models . EOS
SOS and if you think about why it looks so many , many years ago , and so many often often do n't believe that a father does n't have a lot of work for he or he lives in prison . EOS
SOS and then , if you want to think a video boy about what he 'd like to do about his life , he may not even have a better idea of what might look like a different life because he has no better role . EOS
SOS and he served his father . EOS
SOS i 'll call you martin martin . EOS
SOS martin is the key of our program . EOS
SOS his dad was an alcoholic , and he took all my family to hell . EOS
SOS when he was 12 , his mother had died , and he and his little brother had to go home . EOS
SOS there it was the winner of the big bang . EOS
SOS he was shy , and the perfect victim . EOS . EOS
SOS until the day when his baby brother was at a game conference , that it stayed on the ground . EOS
SOS in fact , when you were born the first time , for the first time , when he went up to the enemy and came up . EOS
SOS and that day he became a fantastic player . EOS
SOS and that 's how it went . EOS
SOS violence is exactly about his life exactly as his father . EOS
SOS now , how are i going to share with you now , which i just described on ? EOS
SOS after childhood after the time , there are a lot of unemployed or fathers . EOS
SOS they do n't know much different things as their oxygen activity , and their habitats . EOS
SOS and then you will have a day to prison with people in prison , and then one day to prison , the mind are not a better solution . EOS
SOS what do you think you think these people are in when they sit in prison ? EOS
SOS usually not much good . EOS
SOS and they 'll get better criminals in the workforce . EOS
SOS they sell drugs at a higher level of scale , which is still where they 're going to recover after that . EOS
SOS and that leads in germany in germany to cover percent . EOS
SOS that is , in germany , we 're going to fall back to two criminals . EOS
SOS but there 's also people in prison who really want to change . EOS
SOS but also these people wear a bomb in their forehead . EOS . EOS
SOS and there it goes . EOS
SOS and everywhere you get , your first identity . EOS
SOS whether they want to look at a school , whether they want to look for a place , whether they want to build new relationships as they want to build with this identity , which gives them an opportunity to society so that makes you serious hard . EOS
SOS that 's the problem we face . EOS
SOS how do we try to solve this problem ? EOS
SOS what property do you think you 're going to make a lot of ? EOS
SOS they will be surprised . EOS
SOS it 's robust skills . EOS
SOS in fact , who runs a date together , it has definitely heard of letters , of course , from the way . EOS . EOS
SOS the only thing in the theme of life has been a bit , otherwise he did n't land in prison . EOS
SOS these are the characteristics we want to use for something positive . EOS
SOS we 're going to start our program with a comprehensive education in prison , in three continents . EOS
SOS we 're going to teach the insights of creation and economics . EOS
SOS every student read their own business business , and everybody takes a decent breath . EOS
SOS and then we 're going to talk about the people who , in the end of the season , with their personal relationships , and for example in a different ways . EOS
SOS so what happens out of our program ? EOS
SOS it 's a big bandwidth , it 's a large bandwidth , it 's a large bandwidth , it 's a large
SOS so we 've got a laser video . EOS
SOS a very large bandwidth , and that 's what i 'd like to introduce you about . EOS
SOS countless hundred talent and his illusion of fast money has been doing it very early to trade . EOS . EOS
SOS he always had fun to do business . EOS
SOS he went back to the first time . EOS
SOS and this one of them did n't particularly upset it . EOS
SOS quite the opposite . EOS
SOS he said himself now , he left his peak for the second . EOS
SOS in fact , he went into a second time . EOS
SOS he just took it in a therapy , and then the tail . EOS
SOS and he learned how he could use his own talent for something . EOS
SOS he went in september in september of september , and then finally launched his nobel labor prize . EOS
SOS it 's working hard , it can live on it . EOS
SOS he made a very good job . EOS
SOS he 's here today with me . EOS
SOS you 'd like to know how to do it . EOS
SOS again , back to martin , i had told him to the beginning . EOS
SOS martin has been an honor for a chef and ended up in his spare hours . EOS
SOS and there 's that there and drugs that went on the equator was pretty quick . EOS
SOS he was talking about as tv and as a chemist . EOS
SOS twenty years he took this life . EOS
SOS and he tells me that he did n't work with that lifestyle . EOS
SOS one day he was having someone who was so hard to get someone back at a time he had been arrested . EOS
SOS he took a lot of the wire , and the tail there really changed his life . EOS
SOS he learned how to consume more and more quality of life without having its ability to consume drugs or without drugs . EOS
SOS and he was so thrilled that he decided he 'd like to share it like he . EOS
SOS and he wanted to become part of that . EOS
SOS that 's what it did . EOS
SOS he 's now working on for almost two years now , and our people in their way towards freedom , because he knows that if you really want to change the right tools , and when you want to get the right tools EOS
SOS the basis of these successes are the way they are . EOS
SOS people who are going to come to our prison at the prison at the time , to start with our participants in their workplace , their personal efforts . EOS
SOS these are our assumptions of our assumptions to keep our kids in our class , which are students doing the brakes to do the business force . EOS
SOS and these are our reporters who are trying to get rid of our people right after . EOS
SOS and also these people are taking a lot of our program . EOS
SOS an example . EOS
SOS we 're going to do a kind of exercise that is called `` addiction . '' EOS
SOS we then put into the middle of the room there 's a large , we stand on top of one and our people on the other side . EOS
SOS and i 'll ask different questions . EOS
SOS and every time anyone in the room , there 's a question in the room right now with the line . EOS
SOS and here 's what we all have in common , whether we sit inside the nest or outside . EOS
SOS but also , the differences are true . EOS
SOS and an example of that , where the differences are true , is the question . EOS
SOS i grew up in a social hospital , or i had a journalist , which had been in 1989 . EOS
SOS there are a lot of our students on the line , and we only have a few of them . EOS
SOS one question i 'd like to leave you all together , and i like to ask you . EOS
SOS i urge you all to get up . EOS
SOS maybe we can get a bit of light in the audience . EOS
SOS i can see you . EOS
SOS it 's all . EOS
SOS amazing . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS i 'm going to ask you a question now , and if you 're going to answer this question , you 're going to just stay again . EOS
SOS that 's sort of our line that we 're going to move now . EOS
SOS i had broken things in my life , which i could have predicted , but it did n't . EOS
SOS if you answer this question , please ask me . EOS
SOS it 's going to get to get rid of the risks . EOS
SOS and it 's going to help us even have to have small amounts of ads with it . EOS
SOS that 's not exactly exactly what you 're going to do . EOS . EOS
SOS okay . EOS
SOS and it also matters , maybe we do n't always have any work on it . EOS
SOS all right . EOS
SOS most people sit . EOS
SOS we have a few star in the room . EOS
SOS that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy . EOS
SOS thank you very much . you get all the way back . EOS
SOS in this question , when we put those people down to the events , there are often very often on us . EOS
SOS and many of you will realize how many luck you might have . EOS
SOS happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment in which they were growing , with the friends , but they were also very lucky that they might not always get caught out if they did something on the edge of the EOS or EOS . EOS
SOS what are the results of our work ? EOS
SOS in fact , in spite of our lives , we 're going to find out of their attacks in a workplace . EOS
SOS it 's fast fast . EOS
SOS and i 've already had a hundred percent already . EOS
SOS now , a third of the audience in the past year was the day . EOS
SOS and our death lies at seven percent . EOS
SOS i had told it the five percent of the back to germany in germany . EOS
SOS i 'm thankful . EOS
SOS a $ 100 percent costs in a year per year . EOS
SOS and it 's a nice cover , because what a percentage of seven percent of seven percent of the seven percent , on average , is 95 percent of the standard of times . EOS
SOS when my dad and i started working together that year , we 've been born pretty much for quite crazy . EOS . EOS
SOS i was back in my career with a large company . EOS
SOS but i have to tell you , i did n't do that in my life . EOS
SOS we encourage our leaders to take responsibility . EOS
SOS responsibility , what 's happening in your life and is all about to take responsibility of what 's going on in your life . EOS
SOS not to hide , not too . EOS
SOS because this leads to a whole new consumer , and then allows it to build out . EOS
SOS and that 's why it makes me feel very nice and proud of that when our people come from their way away from their way . EOS
SOS so i made a video video . EOS
SOS movie . EOS
SOS so i was recruited to two years , and eight months ago . EOS . EOS
SOS i was going to go down to three years and 10 months . EOS
SOS i 've had a carrot . EOS
SOS so , i 've got some advantages of two years because of diarrhea . EOS
SOS i was recruited because i was born , and i was talking about it . EOS
SOS so , by my time in the process , i have changed my life changed . EOS
SOS and what was important to me was that , those of the things that were going to do . EOS
SOS because there 's been my absolute self . EOS
SOS i did n't speak , i was almost saying yes . EOS
SOS i 've got some goals back before again . EOS
SOS i 've been looking back in perspective again . EOS
SOS and you 're going to go to a very different consciousness and push out of the arctic . EOS
SOS so far , it has been more and more and more of evidence without any kind of evidence , and then you 're going to push back into anything . EOS
SOS with the wrong people , there 's no longer . EOS
SOS well , the problem is , many of them do n't have any health if they get out . EOS
SOS that 's the biggest problem , because then it is automatically absurd that you get back into the old floor . EOS
SOS you know nothing else . EOS
SOS by this episode of individual records , no matter what everything has been offered to me is just my whole way of thinking about myself , about others talking about the issues of problems , about the power of society that just took me during the EOS of society . EOS
SOS i 've been playing for my first wife . EOS
SOS and since i got six months today , i 'd come back with her together . EOS
SOS so that means we have a new relationship . EOS
SOS and because i also have all kinds of through this whole lot and a lot of other things . EOS
SOS a lot of the things i 've done . EOS
SOS i came home with my family back in practice . EOS
SOS so i 'm working today in mine , which i am saying . EOS
SOS i 'm going to go just on a ride . EOS . EOS
SOS you really have to recognize that there are very , very many people in the room , as for example , my view now are still out of time , and actually , i do n't know , i do n't know , i do n't know , i do n't know , i do n't know , i do n't know , i do n't know , i do n't know
SOS i 'm grateful for that they 've come to the idea that they do something like that . EOS
SOS i 'm grateful for it in spite of certainty , and i 'm extremely grateful that i was part of that . EOS
SOS and of course , of course , all the people who support that they were . EOS
SOS i 've been talking to a lot of people at the same talk , and i 've always met them up , that 's okay . EOS
SOS and that 's what i 'm doing . EOS
SOS and that 's why i 'm thank you . EOS
SOS come to prison . EOS
SOS each of them has something that we need . EOS
SOS whether they want to be our participants in their hands whether they come to us , whether they are in the context of a financial support . EOS
SOS whether you want to wear our program in a new program , it really goes on . EOS . EOS
SOS talk to us . EOS
SOS martin tempest and i are here today . EOS
SOS and let 's look at the conversation with them . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS now , as i 've been working on , i 've been working on a train basis for children 's putting on his own phone
SOS in a time i was a little bit more cold . EOS
SOS there are things like that . EOS
SOS for example . EOS . EOS
SOS let 's go to the balcony . EOS
SOS one spike in the jungle . EOS
SOS there are actually a lot of opportunities for me how to deal with it . EOS
SOS how you can handle it . EOS
SOS but anyway , i was also also disappointed . EOS
SOS with my work and so forth . EOS
SOS which i need to talk about really . EOS
SOS and not by real problems . EOS
SOS my problem was me , i was pretty much as my life in 10 20 , 30 years . EOS
SOS it was devastating . EOS
SOS and these micro-machines thought i thought . EOS
SOS to express it . EOS
SOS in fact , i had a very nasty conspiracy . EOS
SOS as a private service . EOS
SOS i just did n't know how to go away ? EOS
SOS do you make me feel ? EOS
SOS or what would i mean if i put my back again ? EOS
SOS and watch what happens . EOS
SOS which then i 'm waiting for . EOS
SOS that was the thought . EOS
SOS i used to be in that time . i was free at a party party . EOS
SOS as i said . EOS
SOS it was also against me despite that absolute planning for me . EOS
SOS you can live in the world for free , and the country is in a very literal way . EOS
SOS but also , sadly , they 're also very ambitious countries . EOS
SOS developing countries where there are safe more and more to see when there are over 12,000 villages with strange , because they have nothing , so happiness and joy , EOS . EOS
SOS but that 's exactly what 's happening by these images and , but also , a course . EOS . EOS
SOS and that was exactly what it was for me for a while . EOS
SOS i did n't know what i was doing . EOS
SOS on the side . EOS . EOS
SOS i also found a little bit more to do about a country that i do n't really know . EOS
SOS i wanted to change that . EOS
SOS i wanted to meet countries really . EOS
SOS to write articles articles . EOS
SOS and to shake my personal interest . EOS
SOS how do you know how to know ? EOS
SOS by seeking people living with people . EOS
SOS people live in them . EOS
SOS not in the hotel . EOS
SOS by focusing with the challenges and the problems of people . EOS
SOS and by seeking people working with the people . EOS
SOS at least the answer i could give up to this question . EOS
SOS and i wanted that . EOS . EOS
SOS i also wanted to do something more unusual . EOS
SOS i wanted a lot of help . EOS
SOS doing something good . EOS
SOS and that feeling of interest in my mind is even further . EOS
SOS i 've been a lot of developing time in the developing world , but i was very touched by it . EOS
SOS by the time , there was n't an unprecedented civil war , not only massive , but many economic problems left . EOS
SOS with an annual dollars of alfred trillion , china is the poorest country in south asia . EOS
SOS and continue to one of the 20 poorest countries in the world . EOS
SOS a quarter of the population living below the line of poverty . EOS
SOS almost a fifth of the population population of malnutrition . EOS
SOS forty percent of adults ca n't read and write . EOS
SOS all of these facts connected with lots of personal stories , and some of them that i met in this journey , i met myself in a time and open to change . EOS
SOS i want to change something about myself . EOS
SOS and in fact , after i was preparing my decision to make my decision . EOS
SOS i quit my job . EOS
SOS and
