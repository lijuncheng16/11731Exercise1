SOS when steve hawking , the los phone times , one day the streets in the middle of los angeles , he was a wonderful music . EOS
SOS she came from a man , a mathematician , c , c , kenya , who was on a newspaper that had only two . EOS
SOS many of you are going to know the story , because of a sudden , of course , a book later , later a book that came back with robert fellow , when steve brothers , and he was forced to call a professor , the director , who was at the first , and he was using the same career , with robert fellow , when steve was called steve , and he shares the former french , the
SOS and in the end of the first , he left , the average age , and 30 years later , he lived in the streets from the streets from the center of the center of los angeles . EOS
SOS i 'm going to take you all of the word , the book , or the movie , not only the wonderful thing that between these two men , but also how the music is to get out of the street . EOS
SOS i met in the years of 2008 , two years ago , in the traditional union , the traditional union . EOS
SOS he had just been a set of the world first first , and he came behind the stage to me . EOS
SOS he was talking to a very clever and a lot of fun , and david clinton , and about how it would never be able to put in the united world , and that 's all because of the british matrix in the last sentence in the last sentence in the last sentence EOS . EOS
SOS we came to talk to speak to the answer , and a few days later , i got a email , and i got a email , in the middle that i was interested in the front music . EOS
SOS i have to say that a medical treatment , a medical treatment , because he was already working with the u.k. and with a sudden , and he 'd been like to have a poster that he had his whole life . EOS
SOS and as a result of this , he 's particularly proud of these conversations , and they 're sometimes so bad , and he sat out to the streets of the british union , and this is this thing , and the EOS of his own mind . EOS
SOS and in fact , there was so much when we were working with our first ancestors at the first national age of the first few years ago , and he had this terrible thing in his eyes , and he was lost . EOS
SOS he talked about the invisible and the phone , and about how someone wanted to sleep in the classroom . EOS
SOS i did n't fear , but i was afraid that i could make him in one of his states , and that i could talk to him his relationship to the heart , and when i started to talk about EOS , and i EOS other kinds of forms of the EOS
SOS so i started just to play . EOS
SOS and i was the first sentence from the front sentence . EOS
SOS and while i was , i realized that in a new eyes , i was a huge change . EOS
SOS it was as though he was under the impact of a product called a chemical response , who was playing my game . EOS
SOS and they used to be used to understand this in a language , and in order . EOS
SOS and as a result , he took his sister and began to play some of the benefits of the students , and i asked them to play and asked them to play , `` ooh , '' , they EOS . EOS
SOS and we started then talking about music , started talking about the boat , and all the other one , and all of the others , from which they were able to bring up to the edge . EOS
SOS and i realized that he was n't just a personal knowledge about music , but it 's also a personal personal relationship with it . EOS
SOS he talked about her with a passion , and a sense that i only would have heard of my colleagues in the classroom of los angeles . EOS
SOS by using music and talking about music , from this , he was found , the guy who was walking through the streets of los angeles , a little bit , like , had been able to get into EOS EOS
SOS music is medicine . music changes us . EOS
SOS for instance , music means music . EOS
SOS because the music allows him to him his thoughts , and with help with the help of his imagination , and creativity in something like a place . EOS
SOS and so , he created his own life . EOS
SOS i understood that this is the nature of art . EOS
SOS that 's why this is why we make music : so that 's what we 're all in all of us in the inside of our feelings , our feelings , through our brain , through our creativity to reality . EOS
SOS and that 's true of all , all of us , and it 's moving , and it moves us . EOS
SOS what 's going on , the music back into a community of friends . EOS
SOS and the irony force force him back into a family , and he understood him to understand his vision , and it started . EOS
SOS and i 'm going to get back to you , whether if you put whether in the traditional canyon , you can go out , because he asks me why i 've been fascinated . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS tom giussani : thank you very much . thank you . EOS
SOS robert ha . EOS
SOS robert giussani : i want to play something that i 've created with the french . EOS
SOS i hope i 'm hoping . EOS
SOS so i 've been in my life , many fish . EOS
SOS i only have two . EOS
SOS this first thing that was more like a high machine . EOS
SOS it was a beautiful fish , a lot , a place on the highway . EOS
SOS what a fish . EOS
SOS even better , he was used to be able to be used to speak about the most popular effects of sustainability . EOS
SOS so you could be able to sell him to sell him . EOS
SOS i had this beauty of a relationship with several months . EOS
SOS and one day called the head of the company , and asked me if i was in an event , about the roof of the river . EOS
SOS `` of course , '' i said . EOS
SOS here 's a company that was trying to solve what this extraordinary problem has been made for us , how do we keep fish on our heads ? EOS
SOS in the last 50 years , we have the oceans in the oceans like we 've been built on the forests . EOS
SOS it 's hard to put the destruction . EOS
SOS 90 percent of the big fish , who we love , the ingredients , the ones , the ones , the ones , you know , they are . EOS
SOS it 's almost nothing anymore . EOS
SOS so , perhaps , perhaps , you 're going to be able to make a bit like , a part of our future . EOS
SOS a lot of work on the top of the same century , the environment that most of you , and they 're in charge , and they take them , we take a great deal . EOS
SOS he 's got to one of 15 15 . EOS
SOS that means , 15 pounds , 15 pounds , are a chance to get a hydrogen test . EOS
SOS not very clever . EOS
SOS not very good . EOS
SOS so here 's a company that tried to make it right . EOS
SOS i wanted them to be . EOS
SOS the day before , i called the head of the center for the company . EOS
SOS let 's take it out . EOS
SOS `` ma , '' i said , `` just to have the facts right , you 're famous for the sea , so far outside the sea , your environment is n't . '' EOS
SOS `` that 's true , '' he said , `` we 're so far outside that the camera will be going to be in our fish , right ? '' EOS
SOS and then he said , `` we 're basically a different world . EOS
SOS this led to 1 , he said . EOS
SOS `` the best ones in the sun . '' EOS
SOS one , great , great . EOS
SOS `` what does you mean ? '' EOS
SOS `` normal dinosaurs , '' he said . EOS
SOS `` great , '' i said . EOS . EOS
SOS and at this evening , i was in the bed , and i thought , what 's a general protein ? EOS
SOS and so i called the next day , and i 'm just recently before the event , and i called it up the next day
SOS i said , `` you know , what for example ? '' EOS
SOS he said he did n't know . he 's going to go . EOS
SOS well , i 'm talking to a few people in the company , nobody could give me an answer , until i finally went with the very popular company . EOS
SOS let 's say it also . EOS
SOS `` ma , '' i said , `` what are sustainable dinosaurs ? '' EOS
SOS well , he said some people , and a couple of them , and he said , `` well , '' EOS
SOS i said , `` huh ? '' EOS
SOS he said , `` yes , mama , skin , '' and we have to wait with food . '' EOS
SOS and i said , `` how much percent of a percent of your nose is ? '' EOS
SOS in the 1950s , two percent . EOS
SOS `` well , that 's about 30 percent , '' he said . EOS
SOS i said , `` you know , what is it sustainable to be able to get peace ? '' EOS
SOS there was a long time in the morning , and he said , `` there 's just too much of the world in the world . '' EOS
SOS and i made this fish . EOS
SOS no , no , because i 'm a student student and i started . EOS
SOS that 's what i 'm even . EOS
SOS no , i 've actually met some of these fish , because i said , `` oh god , '' the fish after this conversation has been sent to me . EOS
SOS this second fish , this is a different kind of thing . EOS
SOS it 's the most powerful way , the way you want to know that you learn your fish , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
SOS i 've been asked him in a restaurant in the backyard . EOS
SOS a recent book had been known for a long time about a long talk . EOS
SOS it 's got us to get out . EOS
SOS he came up on the table with a light , almost eight white color . EOS
SOS and he had taken him in front of him . EOS
SOS wait . EOS
SOS it was still going to be done . EOS
SOS who can make a fish so much , after it ? EOS
SOS i ca n't do it , but this guy can be . EOS
SOS let 's say it . it 's actually meant to be . EOS
SOS and no , he did n't have the fish , and he 's not an engineer . at least in the way that you and i understand . EOS
SOS he 's a sculpture at the national king . EOS
SOS this is a sculpture in the middle corner . EOS
SOS it 's close to the edge of the river . EOS
SOS until in the 1980s , the united states was in the hands of the cave . EOS
SOS and they were able to be able to what was happening in the mind . EOS
SOS they made it by changing the country . EOS
SOS and they built this beautiful series of wine , and they 're putting out water from the country , and the way in the river . EOS
SOS well , they could n't make sure that the most successful thing was not necessarily . EOS
SOS and it was in fact , it was a disaster . EOS
SOS it took about 90 percent of the birds around , which is to be a lot of birds . EOS
SOS and so , in the course , a german company , a japanese company called the country . EOS
SOS what did they do ? EOS
SOS they have the river of the water . EOS
SOS they 've literally got the most famous . EOS
SOS instead of the water , they used to be able to put the eggs around the water again . EOS
SOS they put the milk . EOS
SOS and they created a very successful artist called -- `` vagina , '' and , like , `` well , '' -- and in a sense , and his company is completely different . EOS
SOS it 's unbelievable . EOS
SOS i mean , you 've never seen something . EOS
SOS you 're sitting on the top , which is a million miles away , and everything you can see , and those who are there , and this dish , and this dish , and it 's called a great miles . EOS
SOS i was n't a long time ago . EOS
SOS he 's an amazing guy , three parts of darwin , and a bit of `` a bird for the dinner . '' EOS
SOS okay ? here we were and we were putting ourselves through the board and i 'd been and put them , and i 've been able to get out to my head , and that 's how i 'm going to have an app . EOS
SOS this is what he put on some of these components . EOS
SOS now , he 's just talking about the director of the mall . EOS
SOS and here , here , he looks a pattern of wood that makes him into the computer . EOS
SOS it turns out that the largest part of his career has been in the developed valley in africa . EOS
SOS and i asked him how to become this one . EOS
SOS he said , `` fish ? i do n't know about fish . EOS
SOS i 'm an example for relationships . '' EOS
SOS and then he goes , and it 's going to be used to more and more effective than some of the birds , and it 's highly strange . EOS
SOS and i do n't understand that wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the extra community , like in the way . EOS
SOS it 's great , but i was in love . EOS
SOS and my head was taken out of this extraordinary piece of wood that i had had been on . EOS
SOS so , so i took him , and i said , `` oh , how does it that your body does so well ? '' EOS
SOS he showed up on the course . EOS
SOS `` i know , young , i know , young , the main relationships that is incredible . EOS
SOS but what are your fish ? EOS
SOS how about the surgery ? '' EOS
SOS now , he 's going to tell me that it is such a technological system that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild . EOS
SOS so , the light , the creator , the institution , that 's what the fish are . EOS
SOS the system is so expensive , it 's completely painful . EOS
SOS there is no food . EOS
SOS ever one of a sudden , which is n't you to get their animals ? EOS
SOS and later , later , later , i went on this slide , and i asked him , `` for a place , for a place that was so much , unlike than every street i 've ever been ever , `` how do you get success ? '' EOS
SOS in the moment , it was like if a pair of a product would have . EOS
SOS and we started to the corner , and we have the most popular ones , thousands and thousands of thousands of the brain , and a while that was a very different way to look at the eye . EOS
SOS `` that 's success , '' he said . EOS
SOS `` you look at her , you know . EOS
SOS they were . '' EOS
SOS do n't ? i was absolutely surprised . EOS
SOS i said , `` well , do n't you do your fish ? '' EOS
SOS `` yes , '' he said . EOS
SOS `` we lose 20 percent of our fish , and we put on the ground . EOS
SOS now last year , last year , on this point , birds , more than 100 different species . EOS
SOS it 's the largest largest , and one of the most important private institution in all europe . EOS
SOS i said , `` oh , is a good deal , do n't have the last thing you want to have to do ? '' EOS
SOS he made his head , no . EOS
SOS he said , `` we 're going to build a toilet , we do n't work . EOS
SOS this is a visual network . EOS
SOS they eat the walls . EOS
SOS they eat the walls . EOS
SOS so , the amount of the way that we can do is better the system . '' EOS
SOS okay , let 's think about this , a farm that 's not going to give you a lot of animals , and a camera that does n't look at your success to the health of health . EOS
SOS one , but also , one of them , but also a toilet . EOS
SOS oh , and by the way , this is not going to be there . EOS
SOS they put in a city in a city of miles , where it 's better for the most time . EOS
SOS every morning , they fly up their miles up . EOS
SOS and every night , they walk out miles . EOS
SOS you can make it because you can follow the top white line of the top of the brain . EOS
SOS it 's very serious . EOS
SOS and i had a sort of journey in front of , so i looked at it . EOS
SOS i said , `` you know , you walk up your miles back to your leg , and then you fly your phone back ? EOS
SOS do you make it for kids ? '' EOS
SOS and he looked at me , as i had a song of a very song from a very cold magazine . EOS
SOS he said , `` no , you do that because the food is better . '' EOS
SOS i do n't like the skin of my colleague , i mentioned the skin of my father , and i do n't like i do n't know , i do n't like i do n't . i do n't like i do n't . i do n't like i do n't
SOS it 's this funny , called the ground . EOS
SOS i 'm never talking about this . EOS
SOS and yet , when i did you in this restaurant , you 've never been able to get rid of this restaurant . EOS
SOS and they made a lot , as if you would take a picture of the ocean . EOS
SOS i said , `` i mentioned it to the ministry of the day , and he
SOS he said , `` the skin looks like a glass . EOS
SOS she 's the last , before something in the body . EOS
SOS it has evolved in the developed evolution of evolution , for example . '' EOS
SOS and then he says , `` but our water does n't have a product . '' EOS
SOS okay , a farm that does n't show her fish , a fire that does n't get your success to your success . EOS
SOS and then he became clear if he says a farm who did n't have an accident , he gave it a lot , because the water that comes through this hole from the river . EOS
SOS it 's a river , which is all of the things that all of the things that are going to be used to create chemical , chemical , chemical movements , including carbon . EOS
SOS and if it 's through the system , and that 's the water , as it 's like it . EOS
SOS the system is so expensive , it 's the water . EOS
SOS so , not just a farm that does n't make her animals , not just a window that does their success to the health of health , but a farm , which is literally an illusion , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me . EOS
SOS because when the water is , you put it in the sky . EOS
SOS one in the ocean , i know , but i suppose it , and that should you also do that , because this is how long , it 's also beginning . EOS
SOS you might say that it 's a source for the future to the future , whether we 're going to talk about or to speak . EOS
SOS what we need now is a virtual new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , in the food , in fact , well . EOS
SOS but for a lot of people , this is a little bit of thing . EOS
SOS we are not a lawyer , we are . we are tired . EOS
SOS we love . we love little . we love small food . we 're eating food . EOS . EOS . EOS
SOS and if you say that the things are the things that the future are good food , and says , `` hey , people , i love `` hey , '' but how will you feed the world ? EOS
SOS how will they feed the world ? '' EOS
SOS can i be honest ? EOS
SOS i like this question . EOS
SOS no , not because we 're going to produce enough to feed the world more than just . EOS
SOS a billion people will have today . EOS
SOS a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because of the former canyon in the fashion , not the most popular . EOS
SOS now , i do n't like this question because they 've been the majority of the only last 50 years . EOS
SOS there 's a very serious place on the board , followed by the basic chemicals , chemicals on earth , and the whole time , and the whole time has just asked , `` if we make more people , how can it be ? '' EOS
SOS that was the main thing . it was the most popular thing , it was the largest american agriculture . EOS
SOS we should call them what she is , is to create a glass , a mirror , the very difficult thing to make a very fast , very quickly , very quickly , very quickly , which is exactly this production . EOS
SOS that 's not a crime , and it 's not agriculture . EOS
SOS now , we 're now today today , not because of this , but because of those resources , resources . EOS
SOS it 's not going to be done by the latest , and it 's through the country , not by plastic , but through the dark water , not through coal , but through forests , and not through the EOS
SOS they want to feed the world ? EOS
SOS let 's start with the question : how will we feed ourselves ? EOS
SOS or better , how can we create conditions to feed every community ? EOS
SOS to do that , look at the future for the future . EOS
SOS it 's really old , and it 's done . EOS
SOS local , chemistry and machines are there , and it never has never good for food . EOS
SOS let 's look at the end model . EOS
SOS that 's the thing that 's two billion years to go on two years . EOS
SOS look at the same level of farmers , farmers , like the future . EOS
SOS now , companies that are not going to be worlds for those who are healthy , and they say , in fact , the most important things that we 're just doing instead of just like , companies who are n't just about , farmers who are n't just about , but experts for relationships . EOS
SOS because they 're the ones who are also experts for their success . EOS
SOS and if i 'm really honest , you 're a better than i 'm going to be . EOS
SOS you know , this is me right , because if the future is good food , you will be careful . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS if i want to give you a thing today , it is that the creation of the data that we 're going to grow is bigger than the sum of their actions and instead of thinking about thinking about how we can use information how we can use information so that patterns , and we realize that otherwise would n't be EOS . EOS
SOS so what we 're seeing here is one of the most active age of age in age . EOS
SOS the program i 'm going to use here is a little experiment . EOS
SOS it means that , and what i can do with it is that i can actually be able to be able to be able to get out of a certain language , let 's say . EOS
SOS and immediately , i see a different pattern that makes you . EOS . EOS
SOS and that 's because there are people who are at the top , and they 're here over here . EOS
SOS we can continue a step further , and the data that 's going to start and see that , and cancer , cancer , cancer , cancer , is not for everybody . EOS
SOS now , if we go to further and after age , we say , 40 years , or we see that in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , that
SOS and who 's shown that this is the particularly thing in men . EOS
SOS so you can see that this looks from information and data in this way to work in a new neighborhood . EOS
SOS and if we can do that to make this for a scientific game , why do n't make it for content ? EOS
SOS what we have here is the most popular majority of every single single single person who have ever been . EOS
SOS it 's all here . it 's all online . EOS
SOS you can love to talk to my talk into your pocket . EOS
SOS with you , they can be in a decade . EOS
SOS you can be in a certain year . EOS
SOS you can actually put them directly to a certain conversation . EOS
SOS now , if i look here , i look at the details that i 'm going to do in this kind of machine , and that 's the cost . EOS
SOS and i 'm an economist engineer , so i 'm going to talk to myself all of these kinds of show that i was going to talk about . EOS
SOS now , if i 'd like to get a poster , i could think , `` ok , what if i want to look at this ? '' EOS
SOS so let me go back a step , and i put the perspective . EOS
SOS now , i see , `` i 'm going to do a
SOS and so you get an idea that if you put on this kind of information , you know , you do n't think or not just that or not just . EOS . EOS
SOS you make something that 's actually a little bit different . EOS
SOS it 's something between , and we think it changes how information can be used . EOS
SOS so i want to start a little bit further about what a little bit crazy . EOS
SOS what we 've done is we took each individual and put them into a small factory . EOS
SOS and the irony is a little bit , and a symbol for the area of the area . EOS
SOS i 'll just show the top of the top 500 500 of the top of the top of the
SOS but even in this sense , we can see a lot of things . EOS
SOS and immediately , we get a sense about the issues that are based on wikipedia . EOS
SOS now , i 'm going to choose the issue of this issue . EOS
SOS now , after i 've been talking about that , i know that the institution that most of us are at least in most of the other days , `` people 's year . '' EOS
SOS this is really important to be important , because this is an idea that 's not in one individual . EOS
SOS that 's just too , if you start a step , and that 's the whole thing . EOS
SOS but in addition to a certain of these , i can then put it in the theme of `` people in the year , '' and all together . EOS . EOS
SOS now , if i know all of these people , i know that the majority of the majority of these things are out of science , some people come from science , some of them , even less , less , come from the economy , from the economy , here 's my head , and one comes out from EOS . EOS
SOS and interestingly , a ted 's ted artist . EOS
SOS so we can now go and look at all of the ted aspects of ted . EOS
SOS you can see , we know , the first time it 's a web , not just from side , but much more . EOS
SOS and so i want to show you what a little bit of what a little bit . EOS
SOS i just show you the new york times . EOS
SOS so , in addition , this method -- i do n't want to call it a call ; it 's really no , but you can see , but you can see , but you can see , but you can see , but you can see , but you can see , but you 're going to look at
SOS so i can go to the step , and it 's just a very specific way of the camera . EOS
SOS that 's why important , because you 're just through the eye in this way , and the whole thing in this kind of activity in the same way . EOS
SOS so i can sort of work in my very certain era . EOS
SOS here 's the middle of the whole audience i 've been thinking about . EOS
SOS and i can talk about what i 've been here today , again . EOS
SOS and if i take a step , and i can look at everything , i can probably help my research , maybe i 'm going to work on my shoulder , and here , i 've been looking for you here , here , or here , to live here . EOS
SOS and from here , i can go into the side , and they come back . EOS
SOS it 's a metaphor that 's always going to be used , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the box . EOS
SOS right now , in this world , we think , is that data is a dynamic . EOS
SOS we 're talking about the rise of the product . EOS
SOS we 're talking about `` jeopardy in information . '' EOS
SOS what if we could take this situation and the internet on your head , so that 's how we 've always used to go from one to the other , to start thinking about how many things can go to a lot of things , and what patterns can see what might possibly be ? EOS
SOS if we can do this , then we will create this test , maybe a new source of information . EOS
SOS and instead , instead of information , we can get it out . EOS
SOS and if we know that , then we can actually take a sense of that . EOS
SOS i hear thank you very much . EOS
SOS and i grew up with a nuclear scientific scientific science . EOS
SOS in my home , i went to the bus at school , every day an hour . EOS
SOS and my nose was always in a book , and i have this idea of thought in other worlds , and in a sense , i think , my deep head in my own , very quickly . EOS
SOS and i realized that if i was n't in school , through school , through school , i went to the forests , and `` jeopardy , '' and i said , and i 'm going to go and put it back home , and under the microscope . EOS
SOS i was totally nervous , you know . EOS
SOS it was always trying to understand the world , and the connections of the potential . EOS
SOS and my love to science , i mean , in my environment , because in the late union , we went to the moon , and i was looking at the moon , and we got the oceans . EOS
SOS and tom is in our living room with his very extraordinary approach that we animals animals and places and a world full of those who we could never have seen before . EOS
SOS and that 's probably good to what you have . EOS
SOS and i was artists . EOS
SOS i could go out . i could sing . EOS
SOS and because there 's no video , and there 's no video to this , and there 's no idea in the media , i had to create the images in my head . EOS
SOS that 's what we had to see , when we were all when we were a book , we took the images of the house , and they were on the screen in our heads . EOS
SOS my response to that was that , and i would like to paint , the worlds , robots , and all of that . EOS
SOS in contrast , i used to get rid of teachers , like i was in the same way i got to see the same way . EOS
SOS the creativity had to take a look out . EOS
SOS and something interesting about that . what i was at was to write this was a very different world here on our earth . EOS
SOS i certainly would never be a living world with a farm , and that seemed to me quite . EOS
SOS but here was a world that i could actually put here on earth here , and she was just fascinating and how all of this was what i 've ever been before when i read these books . EOS
SOS so i decided when i was 15 to become 15 . EOS
SOS the only problem that i lived in a small village in canada in canada , in the next village in canada , in the next ocean . EOS
SOS but i did n't want to show myself . EOS
SOS i took my father , until he was finally a student in new york , new york , had done right on the other side of the sea , where we lived . EOS
SOS i made my job in the middle of the winter in the winter in the winter , new york . EOS
SOS but the ocean is , a real ocean , i got only two years later than we went to california . EOS
SOS since , in the 40 years , the world has been shown , and i have about three hundred hours of water , 500 hours of it in spain . EOS
SOS and i 've learned that the world 's world , the world 's world itself , even in the southern ocean , are so rich in their own life , how we can actually imagine it really . EOS
SOS the nature of nature does n't know , in our sense of our own , our imagination . EOS
SOS until for a moment , i 'm going to have to be interested in what i see on my shoulder . EOS
SOS and my love to the ocean is , with the same kind of stuff like the ones and the war . EOS
SOS when i asked myself as a job , i was a job , it was the privilege . EOS
SOS and the reason the best possibility to tell me to tell stories with stories with my need , to make images . EOS
SOS and as a child , i was constantly making a lot of it , and that
SOS so , the movies of the way , the images and the stories of stories , and that 's what happens . EOS
SOS and of course , the stories that i gave up from the like , `` jeopardy , '' and `` jeopardy . '' EOS
SOS and i was able to connect my design for the ipad , and that 's what i connect with the computer . EOS
SOS so , in fact , my two senses . EOS
SOS something interesting about `` jeopardy '' : to solve a national problem in this film -- and that 's how we had to create such a kind of visual product -- we put on the local phone , and we had to go back to EOS EOS , EOS , etc . EOS
SOS and what was happening was the first step that ever wanted to see in a film . EOS
SOS the film did n't have a money , and he said , `` he was just going to go on his own , but i realized something like this : the audience in the world was like the magic of the EOS
SOS so , according to the law of law , the law is really extraordinary technology , and it 's not going to be more different . EOS
SOS so you saw something . EOS
SOS and that 's what i found to do . EOS
SOS and i thought , `` wow , that 's going to be used to be used to be . '' EOS
SOS and so we went to call two , my next film , a lot more . EOS
SOS together , together , together , we put the guy out of the top , the success of the success , and the success of all of it would come up . EOS
SOS and it worked . again , we had something that was created , and the effect in the audience was the same , and yet , we 've done with the film a little bit more money . EOS
SOS from these two experiences , a whole new world , a new new world of creativity for the computer . EOS
SOS so i started a company , and i started with my good friend , and i was able to go back to the time of the best , and i said , `` digital di . '' EOS
SOS and the idea of this company was , the beginning of this company could start to start with a very serious amount of the same things , and start with digital technology . EOS
SOS and that 's what we did , and let 's give us a while a while . EOS
SOS but in the middle of years , we realized that we were in the jungle and we did n't have the company in the company -- too slowly . EOS
SOS and i had this piece of `` `` jeopardy , '' which is the most popular thing in things that could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be new , with physical effects , with the same human , with physical human rights who have been made by their homes , and they were supposed to be EOS . EOS
SOS but the very popular little beautiful , and the people in my company told me that we 're not able to create the capacity to do this . EOS
SOS so i got this , and i made this other film about the big ship , which is coming . EOS
SOS and i have this as `` a graduate student and a half , '' and it was a very famous leader , a film film . EOS
SOS but i wanted to do the actual edge of the dark design . EOS
SOS that 's what i did the film . EOS
SOS that 's the truth . the studio did n't know that . EOS
SOS i 've convinced you , and i believe , `` we 're going to go to the movies , and we forget the real fire . EOS
SOS we 're going to show it in the course of the film . EOS
SOS that 's pretty important . it 's a good deal for marketing . '' EOS
SOS and i 'm going to put them to be a weapon . EOS
SOS it sounds crazy . but that 's back again that the ability to create a reality . EOS
SOS we actually built six months later , a reality , where i was in a german , four miles under the surface of the north , and i was the real director by a nuclear accident . EOS
SOS that was n't a film , not a joke , that was real . EOS
SOS so that really changed me . EOS
SOS and they were huge , and we had to go cameras and make all kinds of things . EOS
SOS and i looked at how much of these tools , of course of a sudden . EOS . EOS
SOS well , they were able to be able to be able to accept and was able to be able to get
SOS you can go into this , you put into this dark , and we put it in this dark , where there 's not hope if you do n't make it yourself . EOS
SOS and i thought , `` wow , that 's just when i was in a plane . EOS
SOS that 's real cool . '' EOS
SOS and i was really excited to the study of the spectrum . EOS
SOS and remember the part of the part of the wrong science and science . it was all of it . it was amazing ; it was funny . EOS
SOS and it was an experience i could n't give me . EOS
SOS because , you know , i could imagine a human effect for that we could make a mathematical effect , but i could n't imagine what i would look outside outside of the body . EOS
SOS and in some of the most recent , i have seen a lot of people in this morning , and sometimes things that i 've never seen before before , sometimes even things that had never been found before . EOS
SOS so that 's true , and i wanted to be more . EOS
SOS and so i met a little bit crazy decision . EOS
SOS after the success of `` the `` '' '' i want to say , `` okay , i want to put my sons as a teenager in the ice , and i 'm going to have a few years . '' EOS
SOS and then we started , we started to call the `` `` jeopardy , '' and i put them together . EOS
SOS we went back to the edge of the river . EOS
SOS we took small robots that we built to build a product . EOS
SOS our desire was , and we found the inside of the sea , which had never been done . EOS
SOS nobody had ever taken the head of the ice , but you did n't have a big deal , so we developed technology . EOS
SOS well , i 'm sitting on the top of the sea , and in a cage , and see that , that 's pretty clear , and i know that once you 've got the wall here . EOS
SOS and i went through a little clip through the edge of the amazon . EOS
SOS i 'm actually not just about this , but my consciousness is within the classroom . EOS
SOS it felt like i 'd be able to put in the middle of the rainforest . EOS
SOS this was the kind of a product that i 've ever been in , because before i was a corner , i knew i was looking at a corner , i knew what was going on in the middle of the lake , i would have been writing a film in the middle of the EOS
SOS and the result was , a very popular version of the amazon 's part of the amazon . EOS
SOS so that was a very interesting experience . EOS
SOS and she made me this thing that you use such a product that you can use such a product , and that 's your own consciousness in the car , in which other form of existence could be able to be . EOS . EOS
SOS it was really quite complicated . EOS
SOS and maybe a little bit about what might happen in a few decades , when you have to explore something to explore something like other things , or to do other things that i can imagine . EOS
SOS after this , we started to learn what we 've been able to learn because we 've been able to learn how to learn this , like we saw this incredible animals , and that 's sort of like , but here 's where there EOS
SOS they live with help . EOS
SOS they do n't exist in the sunlight , like we do that . EOS
SOS and that 's how you see animals , the right next to a 500 degrees , you can survive . EOS
SOS for the same time , i was also very interested in , which was my father from my childhood . EOS
SOS and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and that they have to do with the research , and they 're sitting in and right now -- they go to japan , and they go to russia , and they take our hearts . EOS
SOS that was fascinating . EOS
SOS but at the end of the end , i was going to go into the box . EOS
SOS and i took them to me , and i took them access to the world here : `` oops , '' i took people who 's interested in such common situations , and i took them to the materials , and i took them to the EOS , so they could go and sell and sell EOS . EOS
SOS we did n't know , but actually , science , more science , more said , `` ooh . '' EOS
SOS so , as a result , the circle between my existence as a child , when a child , and that 's the power of reality . EOS
SOS in the course of this , i have a lot of learned . EOS
SOS i 've got a lot about science , but i think you can probably think of a sudden to be able to have a leader , a teacher like a computer or like that . EOS
SOS but i did n't mind , but i do n't want to get a lot of weight before i was doing this . EOS
SOS because i had to say , `` what do i mean ? EOS
SOS why do i do that ? what comes out ? '' EOS
SOS these films , there are no money . EOS
SOS we 're just going to play a lot , and we do n't play with a lot of light . EOS
SOS all thinking , i think , between `` jeopardy , '' and he would have put up the chair on a screen on the beach . EOS
SOS i have all of these films , this chart for a very small audience . EOS
SOS no , no , no no , no money . what are you doing ? EOS
SOS you 're doing it to the task for the challenge of the challenge , and the ocean is the most expensive environment that you have . you 're doing it in the middle of the room , and because of the strange connection , when a small group of people a team EOS
SOS because we 've done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been given for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the morning . EOS
SOS and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that , you know , because you see a task that you ca n't explain anything else . EOS
SOS if you look at the country , and say , `` we needed to do it , '' and that 's all the way you had to go to the country , and the real thing , the human being , if you 're on the ground , you ca n't explain anything . EOS
SOS there is a connection , a lot of noise . EOS
SOS so when i came back to my next film , i tried to be able to use the same thing , and that 's that you 're going to get his team and feel in the sense of your own care . EOS
SOS and that 's what it was really changed . EOS
SOS so there i was a little team on a small team on top of a small team . we were called `` jeopardy '' with a new technology that was n't before . EOS
SOS sebastian betti . EOS
SOS an incredible challenge . EOS
SOS and we 've been used for a period of a second family . EOS
SOS and it changed my way to make movies , completely . EOS
SOS there were people who said , `` we would have this tendency , and we would really look at the planet in the planet . EOS
SOS for me , there was more to be an extraordinary way to do my job , the real process that has changed in the ways . EOS
SOS so what can we do from all of this ? EOS
SOS what do we learn ? EOS
SOS and i think that first is the most popular response . EOS
SOS it 's the most powerful human brain . EOS
SOS our imagination is a force that can create a reality . EOS
SOS and the little bit of your team is more than all of this world . EOS
SOS and to me young , i said , `` give me a letter of how i can do something like this . '' EOS
SOS and i say , `` you do n't want to yourself . EOS
SOS the other thing you 've got to do is n't do it yourself , not against yourself , but take risks on you . '' EOS
SOS so , the nasa has such as a result , `` no alternative . '' EOS
SOS but in art , in art , in order to be an alternative , because there 's a little bit . EOS
SOS not important to the innovation , the innovation has no risk . EOS
SOS you have to be willing to take your risks . EOS
SOS that 's the idea i 'd like to give you to the path of the way , is a alternative , fear , fear . EOS
SOS today i talk to you about energy and climate . EOS
SOS and the reason maybe something , because i think of my favorite interest in the public world , in terms of science , to the things that we need to create , and we need to make the poorest two billion a better life . EOS
SOS but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even though even more important than any other on the planet . EOS
SOS it means that their ancestors are over many years , and we 're not going to grow too much , or too little bit , and things will change as much as they 're going to change their own environment . EOS
SOS that 's going to make it , and it leads to it . it makes it . EOS
SOS and so , you 're going to be an objective effect for you . EOS
SOS and also , in fact , the institution for them is very important for them .
SOS the fact is that if you could only reduce one thing about the price , it 's energy , energy would be energy in the lower way . EOS
SOS well , this is about the time . EOS
SOS in fact , there 's the private dimensions on the board . EOS
SOS so , the most popular revolution in the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a great case in the classroom , and so we 've been able to go out , and that 's why we 've done , we can create modern materials and lots of things . EOS
SOS so we 're in a wonderful situation in the rich world . EOS
SOS but if we went to the price , let 's go to the price of the price -- we 'll let them go to a new , and that we are moving with co2 together . EOS
SOS co2 is the planet , and the evidence of co2 is actually quite clear . EOS
SOS and they put this out of light co2 , which leads to the board , and that they have some very specific consequences , and that means that in the atmosphere , and perhaps worse , the results that the natural species can not be able to change and all of these systems . EOS
SOS now , the most important thing between a computer and the process of the process and where the other consequences are there , and there are some of them , but not a lot . EOS
SOS and there are certain things about how bad will be these , but they 're going to be extremely bad . EOS
SOS i 've asked the following two times , `` do we have to come down to close zero ? EOS
SOS not half half a month ? '' EOS
SOS the answer is , until we get to close zero , the temperature is going on . EOS
SOS that 's why it 's a big challenge . EOS
SOS it 's very different than we say , we have a trillion feet of high oil , which is under a three feet in the future , and you can then take a look at it out of it . EOS
SOS that 's going to go down down to zero . EOS
SOS well , we 're spending every year a lot of a lot about 1,000 billion tons . EOS
SOS every americans about 20 tons , people from poor countries less than one . EOS
SOS in average , there are about five tons of every planet . EOS
SOS and somehow , we have to make changes that are on zero . EOS
SOS it 's got a few days ago . EOS
SOS just a different economic changes , and it 's all right , and we need to go from the private economy , and to a close to zero . EOS
SOS this equation has four things . a little bit of -- you have this thing -- co2 -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero zero , and that 's going to be used by the number of people , from the number of people , the average of average energy , the average energy per capita will . EOS
SOS so let 's look at each other , and we think how to get it on zero . EOS
SOS probably , one of those numbers have to come very close to zero . EOS
SOS now , this is a basic dynamic , but let 's go through it . EOS
SOS first , we have the population . EOS
SOS today , there are people now billion billion people . EOS
SOS and it 's based on nine billion , which is at nine billion . EOS
SOS if we really successful with new warming , who can be able to be able to create 10 percent to 15 percent , but in time , we 're going to see an epidemic in a nuclear field . EOS
SOS the second thing is the most important tool we use . EOS
SOS that 's all the food that we eat , clothing , tv , etc . EOS
SOS these are very good things , and it means to make this environment in almost every planet . EOS
SOS it 's great , this number line . EOS
SOS in the rich world , in the upper billion , we may be able to make a lot less , but in average , but in average , this number every year , and that 's more than a half of a person that 's going to be a person . EOS
SOS so here we 're going to see a very serious model , and there 's home light , so you can read your fingers ? EOS
SOS and those students do n't have it , so they go out and read their shoes under the classroom . EOS
SOS well , at the rate , the phone , the energy is built , there 's all good news . EOS
SOS we have something that does n't go . EOS
SOS because of the different principles in the '50s , through other dimensions , through new ways in the 1970s , there are many , and then many of them , their numbers , some of them are actually going to reduce 90 percent by 2050 . EOS
SOS in other ways , as the result of plastic , the name of plastic -- the traditional dimensions , or the ministry , or in many ways , the very small thing for a very small way . EOS
SOS so , in fact , if we 're optimistic , maybe we might be able to give a $ scale or maybe a factor of six . EOS
SOS but in the first three years , we 're now today today , we 're now today today , maybe 13 billion tons , and that 's not enough . EOS
SOS so let 's look at the fourth scale -- and this becomes a -- that 's the amount of co2 that will be built by a cell . EOS
SOS it 's the question of whether you can get it on zero . EOS
SOS if you go on the ground , no . EOS
SOS if you 're natural gas : no . EOS
SOS almost every alternative for electricity is co2 , except the amount of energy , and in fact . EOS
SOS so , what we need to do is to make on a global level is a new system . EOS
SOS we need to bring . EOS
SOS now , if i want to use the term , i mean , `` hey , '' i do n't want to do it . EOS
SOS it 's a miracle . the computer is a fantastic . EOS
SOS the internet , the internet , is a miracle . EOS
SOS the people here are too many of these kinds of physics . EOS
SOS normally , there 's no doubt that you need to have a mission to a certain event . EOS
SOS normally , you 're just going to go out and some people , others . EOS
SOS in this case , we have to be able to give up a mission in a very short time . EOS
SOS well , i wondered , how can i really like this ? EOS
SOS is it a natural dynamic , a teacher that is the idea of people here ? EOS
SOS i took myself on last year , when i was a teenager , and i sort of got people that . EOS
SOS and the idea was really , really , you know , there are people who live with life . EOS
SOS for energy , this one . EOS
SOS and i decided that the oil was going to be used to be my current computer to the environment . EOS
SOS so here 's a few natural property . EOS
SOS and you 've told me that you 're not going to do n't know . in fact , you 're not going to go to the glass . EOS
SOS well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they do n't bring all kinds of information . EOS
SOS we need solutions , either one , or a few of them have a common structure , and they even even though there are many ways that people are looking at , and in fact , i 'm just going to see five five people who can afford these big EOS . EOS
SOS i 've got , and i think , `` i 've got , '' and i 've been able
SOS this may be a little bit , and if you could afford better than i would expect , the great thing , but my favorite thing here is that we have to work on all of these very five , and we ca n't do EOS because they have to give us because all of them have EOS problems . EOS
SOS if we look at first , we 're going to continue to reduce solar fuels , because of either earth or natural gas . EOS
SOS what you have to do is , you might probably think , but it 's not . you would have to be all of the co2 that 's coming out of the heart of the game , and you hope that there is going there . EOS
SOS there are some of these things that have been on a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it becomes 100 percent to get very difficult , and it 's an attempt to make it for a sense of co2 , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the EOS
SOS who will make it ? EOS
SOS who can predict something , which is a lot of billions of billions of times bigger than any kind of animal that you can imagine from that point of that and other things ? EOS
SOS that 's a lot of fun . EOS
SOS so that 's a very tough dynamic . EOS
SOS next thing : well . EOS
SOS there are also three big problems , the cost of most of all countries are high countries , the question of security that you really feel that there is nothing wrong , despite the human being used for weapons . EOS
SOS and what do you do with it ? EOS
SOS because even though it 's not very big , there 's a lot of interest . EOS
SOS so three very difficult problems , which may be a lot , and they should be working on that . EOS
SOS the last three of the five ones i have . EOS
SOS it 's the very expensive plant , as you 're going to call them . EOS
SOS and even though -- although it 's great , they need no longer need -- they have some options . EOS
SOS for one , we can create these technologies to be more than the ones . EOS
SOS that 's because they 're talking about many , a lot more than a normal power . EOS
SOS and that 's also what these christians are . EOS
SOS the sun does n't seem the day , but it does n't seem any day , but just as much as the wind does n't always get away . EOS
SOS that 's why you have to focus on this material , a way that energy is even if you 're not available . EOS
SOS so there are big ingredients here , there are challenges in the general , and when we say about to say that the power of the country is not just the technology , not only the technology , and you also need to deal with risk that the energy is different . EOS
SOS and there 's the main script . EOS
SOS and to show the internet , i have all kinds of things that are made up : that for cars , computers , mobile phone , and i 've been able to produce less than 10 minutes of the EOS
SOS so we need a big idea , something that 's going to be better than the amount of the time . EOS
SOS that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy . EOS
SOS that 's what happens when you try to try to say this , we 've been 20 percent -- 30 percent of the road . EOS
SOS if you want to have 100 percent of you , you need an incredible . EOS . EOS
SOS now , where we should go , what is the right approach ? EOS
SOS a `` star project ? '' how are we going to target ? EOS
SOS what we need are many companies that are working on this . EOS . EOS
SOS in each five areas , we need at least 100 people . EOS
SOS in many , you will say , `` you 're crazy ! that 's good . EOS
SOS i think there are in the ted group , there are many people who are already in there . EOS
SOS bill big has a bunch of companies , one of the other one , one of these great heroes has . EOS
SOS and they 're going to be able to grow in new companies , and interesting opportunities and interesting opportunities , and i try to support it . EOS
SOS and i was a company , and i wanted a company , who , maybe , very , the most powerful approach to be . EOS
SOS there are some innovation in the middle of the sky ; the name , the sound . EOS
SOS so the development has been in this industry , and so it 's not a great surprise that some good dinosaurs . EOS
SOS and that means that you instead instead of a part of the one , one percent , the one percent , we decided to reduce 99 percent , to reduce the 99 percent , is that we need . EOS
SOS that 's a pretty crazy idea . EOS
SOS but in fact , you 've been thought about a long thought , but you could never be able to see what it was going to work , but since there was modern crime , you can see it , and see that , yes ! EOS
SOS and because you 're using this percent percent , it 's very much better . EOS
SOS in fact , you can see the cell , and you can even use the use of today as a product . EOS
SOS instead of thinking about the head , you just get it . a great thing . EOS
SOS it 's going to be used a little bit like a tree . EOS
SOS you can see that it 's a kind of a human being often as a `` star wave . '' EOS
SOS the really thing really changed is this . EOS
SOS here 's a picture of a place in a place . EOS
SOS this is the camera , the 99 percent , and you 've got the part of today today , and so it 's called `` it '' EOS
SOS this is the united states for hundreds of years . EOS
SOS and if you 're going to go through and simple , you can get enough to the physical age of the planet . EOS
SOS you know , there 's a lot of challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to come forward . EOS
SOS let 's think how to measure our success success . EOS
SOS how should we look at our own ? EOS
SOS well , let 's go to the target we need to do , and we 're talking about the cave . EOS
SOS a lot of talk about a 80 percent of 80 percent in 2050 . EOS
SOS it 's really very important that we get there . EOS
SOS the rest 20 percent will be in poor countries , and still there 's something agriculture , and hopefully will be able to be able to be able to be like to be . EOS
SOS so , to reach this 80 percent , the world , including countries like china , they create their own property . EOS
SOS the other thing that says whether we 're going to use the technology technology , whether it 's in all developed countries , and we 're on the way to get to the rest of the rest . EOS
SOS that 's great important . EOS
SOS that 's a result of this puzzle . EOS
SOS if we go from there , how should it look like this ? EOS
SOS it should be a little bit of elements . EOS
SOS we should be able to use the tools to bring on the path , and we need to get less , the cost will be going to be the source and the temperature . EOS
SOS but in fact , this is how the things that we do business , which are n't completely entirely to the big bang , just in the same way , or even a bit less important than the other , which is the effect of innovation for these disorders . EOS
SOS and we need to be able to understand this , and we can be able to measure this , and we 're able to measure it , and we create . EOS
SOS there are many great books to this issue . EOS
SOS the al gore book , `` we have the choice , '' and david call the david , and david uses a crime called the sea floor . EOS
SOS and they 're really going to go through , and create a sense of where they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of all sides
SOS there are some examples that come together . EOS
SOS that 's a wish . EOS
SOS it 's a very difficult wish that we 've created this technology . EOS
SOS if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could take the president , and i love the president , and i love , or i could be able to choose this wish , which is , of course , would n't get rid of co2 , and i EOS
SOS this has the biggest impact . EOS
SOS if we 're not going to get this wish , the oil between the world , and most people are going out between the united states and china , between poor and poor countries , and almost all of life will be very much worse . EOS
SOS so what do we need to do ? EOS
SOS what do i do for what ? EOS
SOS we need to use ourselves for more . EOS
SOS if countries are in places like they were , they should not only talk about co2 . EOS
SOS you should be able to put these graphs , and they would have been used to be used by the most small ones that were going to be used for this very low . EOS
SOS we need to create co2 networks , we need to make co2 , we found something that 's going to make a product . EOS
SOS we have to spread the message . EOS
SOS we need to be able to bring physical and have a lot of the things that are going to be done by the government . EOS
SOS it 's a important wish , but i think we can do it . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS thank you . EOS
SOS thank you . thank you . EOS
SOS thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this ? EOS
SOS bill gates : for example , for example , to get all of scientists , what we 've done , we need to take a few 10 million , and even if we have our materials in a modern space , to make sure that it works in EOS mil
